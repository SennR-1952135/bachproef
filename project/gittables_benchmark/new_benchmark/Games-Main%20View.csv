0,Home,W,"Missing defence (Eamonn, Will, Ethan) so Bobby and Jack  / Leo and Luke Mikes played at back. Opposition only had 8 so removed max d at 2-0. Rainy.
Great passing in new formation, players working for each other. Leo spotting danger and tracking back well. Alfie good too, spotting passes to side and back. Khye strong. Brad making good runs and composed in finish. "
1,Away,L,"Very wet. Quite a few goals slipping through Roman or dipping in over his head. Khye head went down because of result but played well. Max B had good game, with 2 shots on target. "
2,Away,W,Great hard working performance. Midfield dominated by numbers. 
3,Away,W,Opposition first game together. No subs for either team. Ref gave yellow card to their player for repeated double footed challenge.
4,Home,W,Khye accused of punching player in ribs during throw-in. 
5,Away,W,"Small pitch, goals. No Roman: Fraser & Max D play in goal. Started w/9 player - Khye arrived 5 mins into game, Bobby at half time (slotted in DF well). Rigby did well driving into box from RM. Zane needs to shoot earlier. Khye passing excellent, working well w/Alfie."
6,Home,D,"Downhill pitch. Higham played 4 in defence and high defensive line, so caught offside a lot in 1st half and midfield got in each others' way. Team got grouchy, Alfie frustrated/disengaging. Had a few 1-on-1 chances to win it as game went on but their goalkeeper kept them in it. Khye blasted 1-on-1 over bar late on and walked off upset."
7,Away,W,"Small pitch. Rain. No Roman so Ethan played 30 mins & Fraser + Brad 15 mins each. 3-0 up at half time. Their goal scored while they had 10 players on the pitch. Ref was good apart from that. Max D trying too hard to score - sometimes a pass was better. Rigby tracking well. Khye needing to hold midfield position better, but improved. "
8,Away,W,"Windy day, small pitch. Should have won by more but Stonydelph got people behind the ball and we didn't see players behind in better positions. Max sluggish in warmup and suffering on confidence. Zane won (and took) a penalty late on when fouled by the keeper, but saved by keeper "
9,Away,L,"Close match, goal was a cross that hit the post and bobbled across the line, a fluke. Brad had a groin injury but played parts, Will had to spend time off with a heel injury too."
10,Home,L,Very strong team. 0-6 at half time but boys worked hard second half to keep them out. Switched to 3-4-1 after 5 mins. Max D co-MOTM and Eamonn opposition MOTM.
11,Away,L,"Penalty area was 11 a side width and ref awarded 2 penalties to opposition, one against Ethan and a soft one against Will. Neither would have been inside 9 a side area."
12,Home,L,"Both ref and opposition said score didn't reflect game. 2 conceded from goalkicks direct to opposition - one by Fraser, one by Max D. 2 defence splitting passes. Looked more threatening when Jack on RM."
13,Home,W,Good passing game. 3-0 at half time. 2 hat tricks for Zane and Khye
14,Away,W,"No Roman so Ethan, Brad and Max took turns being in goal for 20 mins. Went behind when Brad hit ball out of goal to opposition player who scored. Alfie left the pitch schortly after (returned for last 5mins once we were 3-1 up). Pitch was crammed and play was nervous so switched to 2-4-2 for last 20 mins."
15,Home,W,"Captain: Alfie. Hardworking game in muddy conditions. Alfie excellent as captain, positive encouragement on the pitch and while sub. Khye MOTM for tracking back, passing. Will ref MOTM, Roman opposition MOTM"
16,Home,L,At Boldmere St Michaels
17,Home,D,"At Streetly Academy. Scrappy game, players afraid to commit and lashing at ball. Alfie storms off as soon as we go 2-1 down but returns for 2nd half."
18,Home,L,"Friendly while we have a bye in the cup. One touch passing and through balls undid us, plus Ethan L trying tricks and losing possession. "
19,Away,W,"Captain: Ethan L
No Roman so GK: Ethan, Brad & Max
Organised performance until final 15 mins when too many trying to score. Ethan L guilty of overplaying at times."
20,Away,L,Captain: Alfie. 2-0 up after 15 mins but lost in last 5 minutes. Dominated with lots of corners. Alfie walked off when we went 3-2 down but came back on to take corner and fought hard for last few mins
21,Away,L,"Captain: Fraser. Only 9 players, no Roman. Fraser and Ethan play half in goal each.
Playing with 8 (No Bobby) for the first 10 mins when conceded the first, and the other 2 were goalkeeping errors where Roman would have used his hands (Fraser punched ball out to their player, Ethan tried to kick and it bobbled massively over his leg) "
22,Home,W,Captain: Rigby. Joycey manager as PB in Albania. Only 9 players again so Jack played half. Ethan L BMX injury came off with arm pain. Eamoon still recovering from illness & Brad too - but scored hat-trick.
23,Away,L,Captain: Ethan. Playing against the wind in the 1st half when all goals were scored. 2 Roman mistakes - a goalkick into the wind and a handball awarded against him carrying out of the area - contributed to the result
24,Away,L,Captain: Max. No Roman - Max and Fraser in goal. Arrived at KO because mixed up time. Bobby & Fraser arrived 10 mins in. Brad missed a penalty (over top right).
25,Home,L,Captain: Fraser. Alfie Davies debut. No Roman/Ethan L. Professional foul on Brad by no.14 denied a 1-on-1. 2 late goals/mistakes but tight game.
26,Away,L,"Captain: Leo. Fraser ill and Khye pulled out last min so 1 sub. Held them to 1-1 first half when kicking downhill but tired in second half kicking uphill, conceding a penalty."
27,Away,L,Captain: Eamonn. Driving wind and rain - tough conditions. 0-3 at half time with the wind but conceded 5 quick goals until we put 3 in defence. Didn't have many DF options because Bobby came off after 5 mins because of cold - he played last 5 of haf as weather improved but had to be persuaded to go back on 2nd half.
28,Home,W,Captain: Jack. At BSM.
29,Home,W,Captain: Bobby. No roman. 2-0 down after 20 mins but picked up the energy to pull it back on half time. Max excellent on RW with Brad. 
30,Away,L,Cap: Khye. No Ethan or Eamonn so Bobby & Jack played whole match in a 3 man defence with Fraser. Leo CDM and Max/Khye as a roaming midfielder. 
31,Home,L,"Cap: Brad. Worked hard and battled well as Gillway dominated. Striker isolated & LB Bobby sometimes pulled out of position. Needed to take control of the ball - too much panicked hoofing.
No Roman/Khye/Eamonn/Jack "
32,Away,L,Cap: Jack. Max stopped playing after 25 mins out of frustration with ref decisions 
33,Home,W,Cap: Fraser. Full team apart from Alfie.
34,Home,W,"Cap: Roman. George (LM/RM) and Dylan (RM) playing, 5 subs. Tried Ethan RW and LM, Jack CDM, etc."
35,Home,D,"Cap: Max D. No Roman (Asa in goal), no Leo/Fraser for CDM. Khye didn't turn up."
36,Home,L,"Cap: Khye. Dominated the game, but a speculative shot from the halfway line looped over Asa for the 1st. 2nd was a breakaway as Bears chased equaliser"
37,Home,D,Cap: Khye. 
38,Home,L,"Cap: Asa. Playing Eamonn's team, a little slow to the ball. Met them again in the final."
39,Home,D,"Cap: Rigby. Semi final, won 5-4 on penalties. Another U10 side, matched well. Equalised in the last minute of normal time, and went to penalties after 5 mins of extra time. Pens:
Max: scored
Khye: scored
Dylan: scored
Zane: saved (down middle)
Jack: scored
Alfie: scored"
40,Home,L,"Cap: Alfie. Went 1-0 up early on and dominated, but other side equalised & then went ahead before we equalised with a Jack free kick. Early in extra time defence froze expecting offside and opposition nipped in to score winner"
