10,34-42 Woodville Street DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Woodville""- Eco comforts, designer style, country living
Main entry is from Lansdale Court.
Two years ago, the second owners of this property moved in and put a lifetime's worth of interior design career to good use. The implementation of a progressive transformation (both inside and out) has seen the already impressive property really come to life. Utilising the existing passive solar elements, the environmental and ecological considerations of the home have been enhanced and blended with a style that is both sophisticated and comfortable for any new family to enjoy.
Two distinct wings of the contemporary building are joined by a central living space that incorporates a light-filled brand new designer kitchen and dining area leading onto the fully enclosed alfresco that benefits from a warming northerly aspect to ensure that it can be utilised at all times of the year. The kitchen itself has been carefully modeled around the principles of functionality with abundant storage (in the power touch, soft-close cabinetry), fabulous 900 mm oven and white marble work surfaces finished in a timeless provincial theme that is subtly reflected throughout the remainder of the home.
In the parent's wing, a casual sitting room with wood burning heater leads in to the master suite with its opulent bedroom, modern ensuite and custom dressing room. A word of caution for the men though...this is every girl's wildest dream and you may have considerable trouble getting your lady to leave! Fitted with plush pure wool carpets, billowing Shantung silk curtains and with direct access to a private sun-filled deck on which to delight in a lazy breakfast or spot of reading, there is no denying that this is a captivating space.
Equally though, the children's or guest wing carries a charm unrivalled by most homes. Consisting of 2 generous bedrooms beyond the second sitting room, a central family bathroom, separate WC, ample linen storage and further private deck make an ideal retreat for the younger family members from their early years right through until they are ready to leave the nest.
Decorated in modern neutral tones, the home is flooded with natural light and barely requires the use of heating but comes complete with gas ducted, reverse cycle air conditioning and ceiling fans all the same. Plantation shutters throughout the home lend additional privacy whilst the newly installed LED lighting for the entire property builds further on the original economical design. Completely repainted and with literally nothing else that needs doing, this home is the answer to your new home dreams.
Just as much attention has been paid to the outdoor space to provide an atmosphere that simply insists you relax and unwind. Visible from all rooms of the home, the zoned acre of undulating landscape is cleverly 'separated' into various rooms providing everything from a Tuscan styled pizzeria attached to the huge workshop/shed, to the dry creek bed that draws your attention to the bottom of the block and across to a newly developed lake (also visible from the alfresco and living areas of the home). The 'round' allows for balmy evening meals under the stars whilst the arboured walk beneath roses and honeysuckle jasmine seems to take you into a whole other world. Complete with prolific vegetable garden, flood-lit gardens that create a magical night time showing, water tanks and double garage at the entrance to the home, there is nothing more you could possibly ask. Everything is here, done and easily accessed from the centre of Drysdale township just a few hundred metres away.
- Perfect family home
- 1 acre of landscaped gardens
- Lake views
- Passive solar design
- Plenty of shedding and dual access

When this home on an 800m2 block was built it was ahead of its time design wise.

At this time of the year there is nothing like curling up in a chair with a good book beside the ambience of a wood heater that can be done in this cosy living room. The main bedroom boasts an ensuite and built in robe which leads through to a room currently being used as a study but would also lend itself to being a nursery. The kitchen is centrally located; the windows are all around the top of the room, so light in from all directions all times of the year. A large spacious kitchen with ample overhead cupboards and a pantry, combines with meals, family which are the real hub of the home. Two more bedrooms both with BIRs are off this central area.

Wyuna Park, named because of ties with a captain of the Wyuna pilot boat, is an 8 ha/20 acre property situated on a quiet country road 4 kms from Drysdale.
Entering via a long driveway and solar gate, the eye is drawn to a gracious Fasham designed house nestling comfortably in the superb gardens which feature mature trees (European and Australian), a pond and sweeping lawns. This is complemented by a unique Australian garden to the side of the light-filled house which is protected by additional well-established banks of trees and a boutique, award winning 5 acre Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris vineyard (lease or sale of fruit assured).

Excellent shedding, workshops, climate-controlled cellars, comprehensive fencing, large rainwater tanks and drip irrigation from 2 dams all make for a perfect rural existence.

You also have a guaranteed market for Wyuna grapes eagerly purchased by a large local winery. But what could be better than sitting on the outdoor entertaining decks, glass of Pinot in hand, watching the different seasons, spotting the little blue wrens and honey-eaters and just relaxing in this tranquil haven!
