1,2016,Male,
2,2016,,trib is trib-like and seep-like
3,2016,,RHVA found under SWD
4,2016,,surprised it tooke me so long to find a RHVA. Checked the South fork of the seep first. Couldn�t find a RHVA but habitat looked great; coarse substrate and moss mats. Finally found a larvae in the W fork.
5,2016,,"has a gradient of 9 at the confluence but then flattens out (5) and gets mucky; dries out after about 5 meters; 9/24/2016-looks pretty dry, still moist, but only water seeping at confluence with channel"
6,2016,,short trib coming from an undercut of the really incised channel bank; too short to get a gradient; completley covered by fern and oerhanging bank and branches
7,2016,,"short seep, disappears quicklu, low gradient; looked dry on 9/24/2016"
8,2016,,"went back on 9/10/2016 and it was dry; 30 cm wide, silt and sand, no animals"
9,2016,,"seep was low gradient, between 1 & 4 degrees. Not much water; ender after around 5 m. Substrate was good, just needs more water. "
10,2016,,we started survey at m 11 because the seep wasn�t surveyable before
11,2016,,"eyes are just beginning to bulge out; found RHVA around 3 meters up seep (5 toes on back feet, 4 toes on front feet); still has small gills and fin-like tail; seep started looking more like a trib (incised) about where I found the RHVA;pics on phone"
12,2016,,"RHVA escaped before measurment; found at beginning of seep, trib is subsurface so don�t know distance"
13,2016,Female,found within 30 seconds under duff
14,2016,Male,Says between 700 and 750; lots of coarse substrate but was found under duff
15,2016,Female,
16,2016,,
17,2016,,flag is written as 840; area where found was covered w/ duff; 1 m up trib/seep; right at confluence
18,2016,Female,flag is written as 840; area where found was covered w/ duff; 1 m up trib/seep; right at confluence
19,2016,,Everything is covered by mucky sand and duff RHVA found under duff; 6 m from trib
20,2016,,
21,2016,,".5 meters long, cant follow up, goes subsurface; 9/28/16-still flowing H20, channel becomes very incised immed. After"
22,2016,Female,0
23,2016,,"Habitat is not a seep, intermittant trib or side channel. Channel is deeply incised but isnt currently flowing. 27 m long"
24,2016,Female,area where found was completley covered with duff
25,2016,,
26,2016,Female,first torrent under wet duff
27,2016,,"looks nice, surprised no RHVA"
28,2016,,
29,2016,,
30,2016,,
31,2016,Female,"lost of the seep is covered by downed wood, found under a piece of wood"
32,2016,,1 m long then disapears under trees
33,2016,,"short, ~2 m until patch of skunk cabbage"
34,2016,Female,"Started following a supposed seep. The second I pulled back a fern I was a RHVA. This seep goes sub surface a few meters up from RHVA. While walking back to measure the dist. From main channel, I realized this was not the original seep. I had followed but iwa a fork and I couldnt figure out where it entered the main channel. "
35,2016,,"eyes starting to bulge, couldn�t see gills but also didn�t have a bag of water to put it in."
36,2016,,"Pretty much whole area torrent found in is covered by a mat of moss (had to pull it back); right at where the valley starts, hill turns into boggy 'open' area, void of ferns and brush. Covered with liverworts, grasses and other forbs; whole area is pretty much a huge boggy seep"
37,2016,,"Right by SW4; short seep (~2 m), at least part I could see; disappears under downed sitka and brush"
38,2016,Male,there was a small section with substrate but very minimal; RHVA was found on hard clay substrate under a mat of moss; most of this really short seep (~2 meters) is hard clay; pic = male reach 2
39,2016,,found in muck under fern mat and SWD; seep seems to be running dwon an old skid ro ad; can't find an obvioius  connection to the trib. RW found while walking the road alongside the trib
40,2016,,written as 214 on flag and GPS
41,2016,Female,"again there was a good amount of sharp, pointy, pebble sized substrate; found under mat of moss"
42,2016,,"saved and written as 31; seep is composed of pebble sized jagged rocks, seems out of place, maybe was brought in for roads"
43,2017,,"Took ~ 3 minutes to find in aggregate from rock, prob from roads"
44,2016,Female,"both RHVA were found on the side of seep under wood; had to pull up wood/fern mat, were deep under"
45,2016,,
46,2016,,This is definitley a fork in the creek but contains seep habitat; torrents found in gravel
47,2016,,"Really mucky, clay, fines. No presence of the aggregate material seen in other seeps, followed trib around 10 meters until end"
48,2016,,
49,2016,,"surveyed around 3 meters, no animals, there was some more of the seep I couldn�t get to, to suvey because of downed wood/trees"
50,2016,,
51,2016,,"whole seep was searched, no torrent"
52,2016,,
53,2016,,"9/17/2016-seems too dry now, only moist"
54,2016,,seep is coming out from under large old growth log; coars sub but mucky; dark and shaded
55,2016,,"no reason shouldn�t be here, decent seep with f ern cover; lots of muck but coarser substrte beneath"
56,2016,,very small trib with seepy areas
57,2016,,very short area with water
58,2016,Male,All RHVA found in same area; pulled out SWD piece and all tumbled out
59,2016,,Seep is around 1.5 long and is a result of a boggy area just above; reallu mcuky
60,2017,,There's a lot more seep but its covered with dense slash; dry on 9/10/2016
