17,Awarded,"The Scope of the Reactive Maintenance Framework: Drainage 2019 (the Framework) is reactive maintenance and associated work (E.g. call out to attend main drain blockage requiring rodding) to the Client's own properties and to properties of Customers. The Customer work is to generate income for the Client so that it may subsidise its public service commitments.

The Client intends to appoint up to 4 (four) Suppliers to each lot of the Framework.

The Client proposes to make this Framework available to eligible contracting authorities and charities within the geographic regions of: Leicestershire (Lot 1 - Leicestershire), Derbyshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland (Lot 2 - The East Midlands) and Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Midlands (Lot 3 - The West Midlands)

The Framework is intended to be used by the Client or eligible contracting authorities (the Customers) that it grants access. The Customers can include but are not limited to schools, academies, universities, district councils, county councils, city councils, libraries, police forces, fire brigades and charities or similar organisations.

It is not possible to ascertain the precise value which may be generated via the Client and Customers. However, based on the financial year 17/18 the Client's spend was £50,000. The value may increase as a result of the following:

a) the Client increasing its own Client/Property portfolio
b) budgets made available to the Client
c) successful Joint Bidding defined in 2.4
d) where new Customer's call off from the Framework
e) the Client experiences consecutive failures across several sites resulting in a higher volume of call outs

It is anticipated that the majority of Work Orders for the Client will be in the range of £0 to £5,000.

The anticipated framework commencement date is 28.1.2020 for an initial period of 24 months, with an option to extend for a further period of 24 months, in 12 months increments, subject to performance. This will take the maximum framework period to 48 months, ending no later than 17.1.2024.",East Midlands
