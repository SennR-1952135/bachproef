Although we are at the same college ( to some degree we should say that our qualities are similar), we are good in different fields (e.g., our different majors). Therefore, even if we are in the same class, some people will learn, understand, and master knowledge faster than others. However, it does not mean they are smarter people. It is possible that people have different study styles or processes so that makes differences. <br />I think if people have their own study data, they would know much more about themselves and increase their confidence.</p>",,
