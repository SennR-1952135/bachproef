2,Awarded,"St Helens Council is seeking to locate a new library within The World of Glass, Chalon Way East, St Helens, WA10 1BX on both the ground and first floors. The site currently accommodates a visitor attraction which celebrates both the Borough's glass heritage and wider social history. The priority is to establish a library within the current building footprint without any significant internal reconfiguration. On the ground floor, the Library will occupy a discrete area (circa 219m2). This space will accommodate a lending library and on the mezzanine level, a computer suite with printing facilities.  Space in the building is at a premium and the ambition is to allow for spaces to be reconfigured to allow a variety of uses.  St Helens Library Service does not currently have any self-service facilities and is looking to install an RFID-enabled self-service kiosk for St Helens Library users to check out and return books without library staff intervention.
