0,Heath Pratt,annotation,This is an important aspect from both the viewpoint of the Student and from the teacher's point of view! It establishes the requirement for the teacher to provide context and the importance of what is being presented and why!
1,Heath Pratt,annotation,"David Perkins raises the question how do we get youngsters to learn what we have decided they need to learn. From an applied discipline this is quite a challenge. In the generation it is why do we need to know this, it is up to the teachers to provide context."
2,Heath Pratt,annotation,"this is about being able to create a learning environment where deep learning occurs to enable the student to achieve far transfer. ""We train for certainty and we educate for uncertainty""."
3,Heath Pratt,annotation,"This is interesting, the problem is how do we determine what is a waste of time and what is not! The unfortunate issue is the students may think it is a waste of time however, that they don't yet have the experience to determine this. That is why it is important to establish context and emphasis the range of variables in which the concept can be applied and or adapted."
4,Heath Pratt,annotation,"Interesting, I believe he is alluding to teaching the general concept and teaching context in order for the student to achieve far transfer."
5,Heath Pratt,annotation,"curriculum is the most rigid aspects that confront education, however, it must be the standard for disciplines such as engineering etc. As these disciplines develop curriculums designed to achieve outcomes based upon experience of those that have designed them. Of course they must be continuously reviewed to where the industry and the environment in which they are going to be applied."

7,Corey Martin,annotation,
8,Corey Martin,annotation,"How do we educate for ""unknown-unknowns"" (i.e. those things that we do not know that we know). Donald Rumsfeld quote."
9,Corey Martin,annotation,90% of what we teach is a waste of time. What evidence does he have for this statement.If it were true then why do we put so much emphasis on teaching and learning?
10,Corey Martin,annotation,The idea of teaching breadth of information.
11,Corey Martin,annotation,Curriculum is seen as a resistive front of education
12,Corey Martin,annotation,"There is a wealth of information available that can speak to the ways that people live, however curriculum is not structured/based around this."
13,Corey Martin,comment,"The key ideas for my own teaching from the video are:1. Ensuring that what we teach now is relevant (to students and societies lives) and useful for the future whether it be the actual content or more importantly the process of learning;2. We need to be cautious of what material we include and more importantly exclude from a course;3. Teaching of material can be meaningless and a waste of time, thus it is important to review the relevance of material presented in a course;4. Beware of curriculum and administration as barriers to learning and teaching."
14,Till Boecking,annotation,What's worth learning. The question can be posed on two levels: (1) problem-solving skills versus knowledge of facts and (2) what to include in the curriculum.
15,Till Boecking,annotation,following on from the previous annotation: David is talking about learning problem solving skills rather than knowledge. I think the curriculum question is nevertheless equally important.
16,Till Boecking,annotation,"That may be true when viewed across once entire learning (at school, university, ..) but not necessarily for particular courses. Discsipline-specific knowledge is still required in many professions."
17,Till Boecking,comment,Key ideas for my teaching:- consider your student group and why they are taking this class (what is relevant to them)- facilitate deep learning through choise of relevant content to equip students with a way of thinking/problem solving above and beyond the actual content
18,Kelly Royds,annotation,What makes learning meaningful and relevant to  our lives? To our students' lives?
19,Kelly Royds,annotation,Educating for the unknown... preparing for the unexpected.
20,Kelly Royds,annotation,"Wide scope... but then learning specific content, memorisation is also powerful too - depending on what it's used for.."
21,Kelly Royds,annotation,Curriculum is one of the most resistant fronts of education - I can relate!
22,Kelly Royds,comment,"If we accept the idea that 90% of what we teach is irrelevant for most students, then why do we continue to teach in such ways? What creates the resistance to change and innovation in learning? Is it the same across learning levels? For example, there are striking examples of early childcare education that embody child-centred learning to the point where curriculum/activities are designed after teachers have met the children..."
23,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,Teach for the unknown
24,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,Teaching for understanding of wide scope
25,Claudio Cazorla Silva,comment,"From this video I get two main ideas that I would like to apply to my teaching. First, is to teach for understanding the 'unknown'. This may sound a bit abstract but in fact it refers to a possible form of 'deep understanding'. If your students are able to come up with some new content that you did not explicitly mention during your lectures, but which somehow logically results from what you commented, is because they are not thinking superficially (which I think is great!). And second, is to teach while having in mind 'wider scopes'. In my opinion, this is related to the ability of turning learning into a functional skill. We go to university and specialize in very specific fields; however, when out of the academic environment we still need to solve problems, understand complicate relations, anticipate reactions, etc. In some way, both notes that I have taken are intimately related to the concept of how to promote a 'deep' understanding."
26,Omar Hussain,annotation,
27,Omar Hussain,annotation,Educating for the unknown --&gt; good point but for that to happen first you need to know the known first. Similar to vulnerability and resilience in Risk management. You want to develop resilience (unknowns) but for you to achieve that you need to first have a good system that reduces vulnerability (from known events).
28,Omar Hussain,annotation,this can be done if the subject is not a core one.
29,Omar Hussain,annotation,Good point being made here and which relates to the discussion yesterday in FULT of moving from Surface to deep learning. I do that in my teaching where students are taught the concepts but the assignment given is a practical one in which they need to apply the knowledge learned to propose a solution.
30,Omar Hussain,annotation,Very good point and David mentions it is a very challenging point. How can that be addressed? Want to know more!
31,Omar Hussain,comment,My summary after watching the video is:1. My key question would be how to make the curriculum of my course (that is very important in day to day activities) so that it is broad and not just explains the details?2. Most of my students are encouraged to do deep learning by using their assignments. Put in to practice what they have learned in the class in the assignments. Students who do deep learning are able to demonstrate their ability to solve some real world problems. 3. Case studies in tutorials. Assignments etc.
32,Takuya Kojima,annotation,What is the value of learning particularly at university. It should not be just a knowledge in the disciplinary area. There should be something more worthwhile to learn for students. Do actually only students learn?
33,Takuya Kojima,annotation,who decides what they learn?
34,Takuya Kojima,annotation,"If ninety percent of knowledge are not significant fro students, why and why would we teach?"
35,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,contemporary learning
36,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,"It's not all about methods, how youngsters learn"
37,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,teaching contents that gives understanding of a wide scope
38,Takuya Kojima,comment,a. What is more important than learning the contents for exams is learning how to contextualise the knowledge and apply it to various situations.b. They explore more expressions in their own context. They can build more expressions on what they have learnt for their own communication purpose in classrooms and outside classrooms.c. Knowledge is presented in a way that students can make it relevant to their own life and other disciplines.
39,Valentina Bau,annotation,I agree. There are important global issues in the world today that could be translated into a totally new university curriculum altogether from the fairly traditional subjects that are still being taught every year. We need to keep up to speed with the world's pressing issues.
40,Valentina Bau,annotation,"I don't agree with this completely. In courses such as the ones pertaining to Media Studies (which I teach) there are a lot of important concepts, theories and practical examples that are being taught to students. And these are accompanied by relevant and engaging type of assignments, which are industry-related. What is often missing, however, are some of the new angles that the industry is taking. The media industry is changing so fast and so much, that is hard to stay up to date even for lecturers. Students are often more knowledgeable than us when it comes to certain media practices, and they loose their interest when they see these are not (yet) incorporated in the discussion."
41,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This is a key challenge in our teaching practice, and one that we must prepare for. We are often constrained by a course structure that is already in place (and has been for a number of years perhaps) and, personally, I am not sure whether and how I should step out of it."
42,Valentina Bau,comment,"I believe that the university curriculum should stay abreast of contemporary global issues that go behind the traditional frameworks we are used to apply to university courses.If teaching is connected to both a theoretical and practical discussion that students can regard as relevant to their present and future daily lives, a deep approach to learning will occur naturally."

44,Blake Cochran,annotation,educating for the unknown - not just fact exchange
45,Blake Cochran,annotation,curriculum a resistant front in education
46,Blake Cochran,comment,"a. understanding how and why something is, rather than the what something is - importance in understanding how to gain new knowledge in the future and not just learn facts by heartb. deep learning in medical sciences is understanding how systems work, not just surface facts. understanding how current knowledge can be applied to answer new questionsc. inspiring teachers, exposure to deep issues. the ability of the surface understanding to occur first allowing the students to survive and then enter into deep understanding and learning"

49,Julia Lappin,annotation,
50,Julia Lappin,comment,"I found the interview with David Perkins form Harvard thought-provoking and it resonated for me a lot. The points I particularly highlighted were:i) nimble ways of thinking about...the expected and the unexpected- this is a recognition that the world is constantly evolving and that the demands of society shift over time: how students expect to be taught; what knowledge we need to hold in our heads rather than be able to look up; and -for me, in Medicine- the idea that illnesses belong to a time. As new cures are found, there is a need to prioritise learning about how to find new cures for new diseases, and a shift from treating acute illness to more chronic conditions.  ii)understanding of wide scope - the applicability of ideas and concepts is increasingly relevantiii) the ways in which the discipline looks outside itself - this is an important idea- that we need to learn from other disciplines about advances in their fields in order to enrich advances in our own."
51,Mariam Farida,annotation,"i find what David Perkins is suggesting very interesting, as often when i was an undergraduate student, i used to ask how will i use all the subject i have studied back then will help em in my day to day tasks. 1- who eventually determines whats worth learning? i science more prominent than philosophy? i think a student should be able to develop a critical understanding and appreciation to general knowledge by learning about life in general, that involves science and social studies..etc.2- i don't agree with the speaker that all what is being used now is 90% inaccurate. on what basis is it irrelevant? what is the alternative?"
52,Mariam Farida,comment,"i found what the speaker suggests is very striking and it needs more research to understand what the speaker suggests as an alternative to the current system of teaching. but i think that one can develop an understanding to Life when one learns about different aspects of it. such as learning content and its relation to the era or times we live in now. for example, i teach a language course, and i see important correlation between learning foreign language to keep up with the needs of the current times."
53,Sonia Graham,annotation,"While I don't think students need to recall 90% of what we teach, I believe that much of what we teach contributes to building students' capacities to think critically. So while the content might not need to be recalled, if it is used to demonstrate and apply concepts in the real world and build capacity then it is still useful.Despite holding on to most of my university notes, I have probably looked back over less than 1% of them."
54,Sonia Graham,annotation,
55,Sonia Graham,comment,"This video relates to the reading I did of chapter 2 of Biggs and Tang (2007) that differentiates between thinking of what students are, versus what teachers do, versus what students do. It seems to me that what Perkins is talking about links relates to what students do. How can we get them to engage with content in a way that enables them to learn skills that will be useful for them in an unknowable future. Deep learning in my area means students learning how to conduct research and find resources to help them address whatever policy context they are faced with in their working lives. The main course I am teaching involves students learning by doing, therefore there is very little traditional lecturing, but rather seminars that operate like extended tutorials so that students have the opportunity to learn together with guidance and support from academic staff. I believe students need to be passionate about what they are studying. It is for this reason that in my course I've given them opportunities to shape their projects to meet their own interests, yet still challenging them to read beyond the bounds of what they would have read to date in their degree. It has been rewarding to see some students embrace this and find that what initially seemed like an irrelevant topic to them can be interesting and engaging."
56,Julie Thoms,annotation,What is worth learning?
57,Julie Thoms,annotation,Educating for the unknown
58,Julie Thoms,annotation,90% of what we teach just doesn't matter
59,Julie Thoms,annotation,"Teaching content for ""understandings of wide scope"""
60,Julie Thoms,annotation,"Many rich insights in various disciplines, but these are not the things on which curriculum is generally based"
61,Julie Thoms,comment,"I think that they key idea here is determining what exactly is worth learning, since a large amount of content being taught is probably irrelevant to the student. We need to be teaching students not only the foundational knowledge required for their discipline (which for some will be quite substantial), but also how they can go about finding  and evaluating the content they require in the future."
62,Samantha Hornery,annotation,"""worth learning"" - we don't ask this enough, often we are driven by what we like to teach"
63,Samantha Hornery,annotation,I hope 90% being worth learning is not always correct - that is a terrifying number.
64,Samantha Hornery,annotation,"I like the phrase ""how the discipline looks outside itself"", I think in non-professional courses this can be a very helpful consideration."
65,Samantha Hornery,comment,"Terrifying numbers about the value of what is being taught, however a reminder about the need to review the purpose and relevance of what we are teaching."
66,Margarita Mandic,annotation,I have asked myself this question so many times. What is worth learning? Who can truly answer this question? What information is presented is equally important to how it is presented.
67,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Interesting thought. Does DP means being able to predict future issues and problems and design curriculum that would equip future graduates to solve them?
68,Margarita Mandic,annotation,I can relate to this one. So many courses I took in school ended up being useless and information learned was easily forgotten.
69,Sanja Lujic,annotation,What should we be teaching our students?
70,Sanja Lujic,annotation,Bare in mind what might be worthwhile learning now just now but for the future too.
71,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"90% is a waste of time - I disagree with this. Most of first year courses are foundation ones, and they are the building blocks of what's to come. In the later years, and dependant on the program, there might be relevance to most of the content that we learn. In my area, statistics, most of the methods we learnt are applicable in the industry, and graduates feel skilled knowing they were exposed to a variety of methods during their years of schooling."
72,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"I concur that we should be teaching bearing in mind where our content fits in the greater scheme of things. As educators, we should be aware of how pieces of puzzle come together during the student's education pathway. We should be broadening our horizons and drawing analogies in wider areas. This will help students understand the relevance and importance of the subject - and hopefully engage them in deeper learning practices."
73,Sanja Lujic,annotation,How does the discipline relate to others? Will help guide conversations and stimulate deeper learning.
74,Margarita Mandic,comment,"Key points:-It is worth looking into curriculum often and update it to reflect changes, new trends, developments. New fresh content that will equip students with up to date skills and knowledge.-Majority of students that I teach follow guidelines that are given to them. More deep learning would involve looking at case studies, how and where different methodologies can be applied ( Ergonomics course).-Deep learning will happen if there is an interest in a particular class. Interest arises from content, methods of presentation and presenter themselves."
75,Sanja Lujic,comment,"We should move past our own subject silos and have an integrated/cohesive/wide-reaching purpose for teaching the content we propose or do. Transcending our our subject areas is the key in keeping the students engaged, interested and highlighting the importance of interconnectedness between the content taught during their degree."
76,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"I believe this is a two-fold approach: the fundamentals that the student needs to know and the 'extension' knowledge: I would view this more who to teach student to problem solve, to the think outside the box, feel comfortable to tackle unfamiliar material."
77,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"I find this interesting as to how we teach students to learn in 'nimble' ways. From my own experiences, I didn't really click with the problem solving nature of chemistry until my honours year where I was in a research lab full time. Having said that, I couldn't have done that without a good foundation that my undergraduate years. I think it is a hard line to walk of teaching and extending students at the same time."
78,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"I do find it a challenge to get students to understand that not everything that we teach is discipline specific, particularly in the broader context of science there is much overlap in the types of skills and knowledge that we want the students to learn."
79,Samantha Furfari,comment,Broad Education versus Discipline Specific Knowledge..I feel that this is a particular challenge moving forward to allow students to get the best well-rounded education to move into the future.
80,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,How do we decide what's worth learning?

82,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,Who decides what's worth learning?
83,David Silvera Tawil,comment,"It is important to consider that in the greater scale the 'content' of our teaching would eventually become irrelevant. If we provide a deep learning environment, we don't only teach content but the tools students need to reason, research and acquire new content. These are the tools that will help them stay 'relevant' in the future."
84,Li Fu,annotation,Worth of learningWide scope content and curriculumMethod of teachingDeep approach
85,Li Fu,comment,"I am  very happy to learn the ideas presented by David Perkins. It is really inspiring, not only for teaching, but also for academic research. I have been thinking for long about the disadvantage of so-called modern knowledge and education. Modern society divide knowledge into various disciplines and considered it as professionalization, but actually the real world is not divided. Therefore, I think this video provide more in-depth and further understanding of deep approach of teaching. As David Perkins said:  It is a narrow method to just deliver particular pieces of knowledge within discipline. We need to show the way that how the discipline look outside of itself. The purpose of teaching should deliver a method that student could connect the knowledge with the real world. That may be one way of worth of learning."
86,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,most part of teaching is waste of time and will not helpful in their life
87,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,Understanding of wide scope
88,Abrar Chughtai,comment,I agree with David Perkins that most part of teaching may not be helpful for students in their life. Curriculum development is very important in this regard. I think we require more active and participatory learning approaches. Current teaching and learning is exam/assignments focused do not allow students to think deep and beyond the course.
89,Natalie Ross,annotation,"I love the idea of ""nimble thinking"" as an outcome of learning - minds that are light and fast and flexible"
90,Natalie Ross,annotation,"The claim that 90% of what we teach will never be used and just doesn't matter is confronting. I think it probably true that in may courses 90% of the content is soon forgotten and never revisited, but much of it might still be needed as the material or context for longer term and useful learning about concepts, ways of thinking and ways of solving problems."
91,Natalie Ross,comment,"Our courses are mainly small groups doing experiential learning, so we do not really have to grapple with the issues of content and curriculum that David Perkins is talking about. But the video has made me think a lot about my own experience as a university student and how shallow my learning was, and how it took many years in practice before I really ""got"" my discipline."
92,Nicholas Richardson,annotation,I am pleased to hear him say this because this is my focus. I don't teach a discipline I teach a range of ideas from many disciplines that I hope sheds light on my own.
93,Nicholas Richardson,comment,"I teach in a field that is far from a science. It is highly subjective and broaches many different disciplines and so I find myself constantly searching outside my discipline for theory and conceptual thinking that does a better job of explaining to students what the discipline is and how it works. The students seem to respond well to this and so I haven't been too concerned with the fact that I perhaps step outside of 'curriculum' more than some might perceive that I should. Viewing this video, I will do it now with more confidence. I try to throw ideas out there. Some students will engage with some and others with different ones. It is the students that decide their path to 'deep' learning. That, to me, makes the 90% of what we teach is wasted idea a problematic one. I accept that 90% of what I teach is wasted on students but how do I know which part of the 100% is the 10% that resonates?"
94,Wen Hu,annotation,
95,Wen Hu,annotation,
96,Wen Hu,comment,What is worth to learn?90% of the materials we teach are not relevant to most of the students' future career or life. Curricula should to be updated regularly.
97,Hossein Masoumi,comment,I found it hard to believe 90% of teaching is waste of time. My subject consists of fundamental and practical components where students can benefit from that practical components in their field of work or industry a lot. This is based on the feedback that I have received from the students over the last four years. Probably 60% is a more realistic rate.
98,Nicole Lasky,annotation,The comment about teaching deep insights that speak to the way we live is an interes ting idea. Howy would one identify these deep insights and then teach them?  Is it simply intuition and experience to be able to identify these?
99,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"When David talks about ""curriculum"", is he mainly meaning content or delivery as well?"
100,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"I like the idea of ""nimble"" ways of thinking.  There are so many ways to approach a situation and with an increasing rate of change, people have to identify new problems and new solutions."
101,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"""90% of what we teach is a waste of time."" This is a high percentage and a strong indictment.  It makes me wonder which parts are a waste."
102,Nicole Lasky,comment,"1.  I would like to have more understanding of how to determine what curricula is a waste of time and what is worthy, using the idea of deep insights.  Sometimes, the curriculum is set and we must deliver what is given so it can be difficult to alter. 2.  My students mainly want to get a good mark, so they work towards the assessments.  Deep learning is when they challenge themselves and begin to analyze and critique the content.  Application of theory is also helpful to encourage deep learning.3.  An assignment where students are asked to apply, ie. give them a brand or scenario where they can create a strategy and tactics based on the tools they have learned.  Then they begin synthesizing information, analyzing and critiquing."
103,Colin Clark,annotation,"How can one determine what will matter, given that it is described as unexpected? I suppose by focusing on underlying competencies rather than specific knowledge."
104,Colin Clark,annotation,"Curricula should be updated regularly, but somehow negotiated with learners - their idea of what will be necessary for them is probably more accurate that the professor's."
105,Colin Clark,comment,The key issue that arises for me is how 'worth' is determined. I suppose a focus on developing the capacity for learners to teach themselves and think critically is the bedrock of education.
106,Anna Yeung,annotation,"that's kind of interesting to me. As a science undergrad, I'm not sure how much came across about the scientific method and actually how to apply it in the real world. I was mostly with students who were all about 'how much do we need to know for the exam?', since we were expected to regurgitate content."
107,Anna Yeung,annotation,"again, I found my undergraduate science to be somewhat reductionist, and didn't really see how everything was related until I did my masters in public health and learned about the 'social determinants of health'. I think that would have been really useful in undergrad to see the 'bigger picture'."
108,Anna Yeung,annotation,"The way curriculum is currently organised tests students on what they know, rather than on how they think."
109,Anna Yeung,comment,"I found this a little bit hard to reconcile with a science perspective, in that students are taught facts more than concepts, and not a lot of it is 'big picture' learning. My own experience was quite reductive, particularly in the upper years and it wasn't until I went to graduate school that I started seeing the 'big picture'."
110,Juan Alvarez Gaitan,comment,"a. What are the key ideas or questions relevant to your teaching practice that arise for you from David Perkins' video? &bull;	What is worth teaching in the context of my discipline?&bull;	What is relevant for the future?&bull;	What should be included in the curriculum?b. How your students approach learning and what deep learning 'looks like' in your area? If students take a deep approach in your course, what are they able to do?&bull;	They ask good questions&bull;	They provide answers with higher levels of understanding about the topic  c. Can you identify the factors that might be contributing to students taking this deep approach? &bull;	I would love to identify them more easily &bull;	Sometimes I feel is a lottery. It needs a commitment from both sides of the learning experience.&bull;	For me are: how the knowledge in question relates to the real world, how to make it interesting, how enthusiastic I am"
111,Pu Xiao,comment,"What is worth learning? It is very difficult to say. Knowledge is expanded so fast in this age.Maybe ""to learn how to learn"" different topics efficiently is most important."
112,Yue Huang,annotation,"I sort of agree with Prof. David Perkins.consensus: The teacher shall have a vision about what a discipline looks like in the future. We shall set up a curriculum reflect and meet the future challenge. disparity:Although most course the students learned might not be used in their later life, they would learn some basic skills/methods to build up their knowledge, which could be used in practice."
113,Vanessa Cali,annotation,"Interesting idea. And who decides and has the power to decide? The halls of academia, professionals in the field or the student? Is it a mixture of both?"
114,Vanessa Cali,annotation,"I like this idea as it fits in with design thinking. How do we give graduates the attributes to problem solve and grapple with questions/scenarios in the world, rather than just what we already know."
115,Vanessa Cali,comment,"The video brings up for me the importance of supporting students to design-think or problem solve. Creating this capacity in students can create space for the 'deep' learning. When I have instructed the students who have a 'deep' approach (besides doing the readings) have been able to critically reflect and engage in class discussions on this reflection. This is where the greater learnings for them and the class takes please. Those that are surface, don't/can't reflect. Is it because they see the task as not being 'worthy'?This brings up the ideas of what is 'worthy' information. I know that there are expectations of schools that we adequately prepare them to enter classrooms, but some of the feedback is the practical stuff such as initiative and problem solving ability. Is this what we are missing and can it be taught?"
116,Mel Chavez,annotation,"The trouble is this very, very important question is really not asked nearly often enough. I whole heartedly agree."
117,Mel Chavez,annotation,We need to educate for the unknown as well as the known.
118,Mel Chavez,annotation,90% of what we typically teach is a waste of time. We have to do better than that. Exactly my line of thinking.
119,Mel Chavez,annotation,"The way the discipline looks outside itself. We need to teach the core disciples but at the same time, we also need to tie in real world skills demands with the theory. I have read this many times before in course outlines, but I can count very few that actually accomplish this.I will end with two quotes from Bruce Lee expresses my views on education so poetically.&ldquo;Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you follow the classical pattern, you are understanding the routine, the tradition, the shadow - you are not understanding yourself.&rdquo; ― Bruce Lee, Tao of Jeet Kune Do"
