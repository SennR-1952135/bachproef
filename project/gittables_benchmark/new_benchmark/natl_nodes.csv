Founded by Palmetto Electric in 1989, Operation Round Up has been an incredibly successful way in which we have been able to help the less fortunate in our community. Through Operation Round Up, Palmetto Electric automatically rounds up a participating member’s electric bills to the next highest dollar. For example, a consumer’s monthly bill of $52.73 would be automatically rounded up to $53.00, with the additional 27 cents going to the Operation Round Up fund. On an annual basis, we are able to donate roughly six dollars for each participating customer – and that pool of money is then allocated to a variety of worthy causes throughout our service area."
