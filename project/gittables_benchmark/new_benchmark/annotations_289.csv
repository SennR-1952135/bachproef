0,Johannes Luetz,annotation,"""not for school, but for life"" - I love it!"
1,Johannes Luetz,annotation,"I do not really see a dichotomy between ""enjoying themselves"" and ""learning something"" in terms of prioritising. Why not both?"
2,Johannes Luetz,comment,"I am not sure that there is a dichotomy between ""enjoying the course"" (eg, passion in the teacher) and ""learning something"" (eg, the ""stickyness"" of concepts and what remains after the lecture is over). Should not learning and fun go together? At the very least, should it not be a desired outcome...?"
3,Riza Sunindijo,annotation,Make sure that the learning outcomes are practical
4,Riza Sunindijo,annotation,Too much focus on engagement does not guarantee good learning outcomes
5,Riza Sunindijo,annotation,Scenarios to apply theories
6,Riza Sunindijo,comment,Using simulation to apply theories into practice
7,Christy Newman,annotation,I really like this teaching philosophy - I too aim to engage students with teaching content not only to progress successfully through their degree but also to inform their ways of thinking about and engaging with their social worlds
8,Christy Newman,annotation,"Really interesting to hear this view on 'engagement and passion' as a quality to aspire to in teaching - yes, students may enjoy this, but is it really the essential ingredient of successful learning? Or is that much more based on careful preparation, understanding how students learn and designing learning activities in a way that will really get students immersed?"
9,Christy Newman,annotation,"This will work well in smaller group teaching, but could it work in a lecture with 200 students? I'm keen to think about it, as students are currently unimpressed with the lack of participation in lectures!"
10,Christy Newman,annotation,"In teaching research methods, I could imagine simulation exercises which asked students to role play as research teams, to brainstorm research ideas addressing current issues (which could be set for them), and to come up with plans for research that required them to really put themselves in the shoes of the researchers. They could also pretend to be research subjects, funders, communities etc - clearly, this idea is resonating with me!"
11,Christy Newman,annotation,"I like the idea that not only do these kind of exercises help students to apply theory to practice, but they make the content area incredibly interesting to students, engaging them in new ways"
12,Christy Newman,annotation,"Yes, indeed: 'some students are not going to like it'. But we have to have the courage to try new things, and risk it falling over..."
13,Christy Newman,annotation,A fabulous synopsis of good teaching - 'a balance between confidence and humility'
14,Christy Newman,annotation,"It's so important to always recognise that teaching students is a privilege, and that we are continuously learning through that process. Thanks for this video!"
15,Christy Newman,comment,"This video inspires us to be better teachers by taking responsibility for designing course delivery methods that respond to student learning styles and preferences, and to be courageous in doing so! Seeking to achieve a level of confidence in the approach that is based upon how well it has been considered, but also always being open to improvement. Using simulations as a student learning exercise has lots of potential in my area!"
16,Mark Braidwood,annotation,"difference between the students enjoying themselves and learning, not necessarily the same thing..."
17,Mark Braidwood,annotation,Balance of confidence &amp; humility -  a difficult line for all of us to tread
18,Tom Kramer,annotation,"That's the whole story isn't it? It's not about passing assessments, it should be about using the skills and knowledge in life."
19,Tom Kramer,annotation,"Yesssssss! It needs to be relevant to their lives. If they don't see the relevance now or how it will be in the future, then it's up to the teacher to supply an explanation."
20,Tom Kramer,annotation,Engaagement versus learning outcomes? ditto.
21,Tom Kramer,annotation,I like how activities are matched to student engagement and add-value rather than just simply reinforcing content.
22,Tom Kramer,annotation,Need confidence and humility - also flexibility and a plan B.
23,Julie Wilson,comment,Susan's approach resonates with my teaching belief and practices. Especially the points made regarding making the experience relevant to the students and linking theory to real life experiences. The video reiterated why I enjoy teaching and how you must have courage to reflect on your own practice and continue to stretch the boundaries and be innovative.
24,Laura Crommelin,annotation,I think Dr Banki's point about the difference between students enjoying themselves and students actually learning something is important - it's not necessarily a given that something fun is also educational.  Doing both simultaneously can be tough though!
25,Laura Crommelin,annotation,This is a great list of ways to translate theory into practical exercises - I teach a theory-heavy class and I could definitely see how some of these would work really well to help students understand how the theory is relevant to the 'real' world
26,Laura Crommelin,comment,"Both videos stressed that these kinds of approaches take both courage and flexibility - the confidence to take a risk but also the ability to change direction on the spot if it's not working.  As a new lecturer this seems a bit daunting but also exciting, and definitely highlights an attitude towards teaching that I'd like to get better at implementing over time."
27,Zhe An,annotation,For life! That makes education more meaningful.
28,Zhe An,comment,Simulation class provides a new approach of teaching that linking theories and practices.
29,Sue Williamson,annotation,"Yes, good point - while teachers can be engaged and passionate, this may not necessarily translate to good learning outcomes. Me being passionate about a topic isn't enough - I need to make sure students are also engaged and doing things."
30,Sue Williamson,annotation,"Some of these activities are great! Making a video, holding a news conference, writing an op ed, mounting a demonstration."
31,Sue Williamson,comment,"Susan's comments about being confident and taking risks with the material are important. Some students would prefer a traditional lecture, but using these activities brings about better learning outcomes."
32,Niki Fardouly,annotation,"Relevance is the key word here. If something isn't relevant it's hard for students to attach meaning to it, therefore it's hard for them to use it and remember it. Part of the art of teaching is the art of making ideas relevant to students. Without relevance students will not be motivated to do anything with the knowledge other than use it to pass exams then forget it."
33,Niki Fardouly,annotation,"Finally, someone who says that we are here to educate not to entertain. Engagement and passion in a teacher is great for motivating students but it's little more than entertainment if students are not learning."
34,Patricia Arthur,annotation,This underpins the whole idea of not just learning to get the marks - I like this!
35,Patricia Arthur,annotation,Rhe content gets covered as well: and it wil be learned well and retained!
36,Patricia Arthur,annotation,Strong learning outcomes more linked to the preparation than necessarily to the personality and passion of the teacher!
37,Patricia Arthur,annotation,Learning to balance the student feedback: not just changing a strategy becasue a few students are unhappy with it! I have seen courses take all sorts of twists a turns because ofone or two student comments! BALANCE!!!!
38,Niki Fardouly,annotation,"Elements of good teaching: provide opportunities for students to apply theory to practice within the classroom via group collaboration on problem solving, simulations, case studies etc."
39,Niki Fardouly,comment,"Susan Banki is a highly experienced and confident teacher who demonstrates great skill and insight in her teaching practice. It's much harder for a beginning teacher to apply that level of innovation and flexibility and be highly successful most of the time. You have to expect a few flops along the way. Just remember to review, revise, and try again. The key ideas are to link theory to practice via problem solving, collaborative exercises, simulations and case studies and make the learning relevant to students' lives."
40,Patricia Arthur,comment,"Both videos deal with trying to get the students to engage in a manner that is not just to get through a course and get marks, but to 'learn for life.' It involves stepping out and often presenting content in a way that may not be appreciated by the students, but do it anyway! (and have Plan b!) The engagement in simulation classes brings the topic to life and yet still delivers the content. Good preparation is key above the need to entertain: I'm pleased about this! Her comment about feedback - if you are absolutely commited to the method is interesting: why do we feel that we have to change ways we do things just because a student here and there doesn't like it if we are convinced that it is in the best interests of the learning outcomes of the student  body??"
41,Robert Walsh,annotation,Distinction made between creating an enjoyable experience and one in which they are actually educated.
42,Vidhyasaharan Sethu,annotation,"I completely agree with this - if a student is able to appreciate the relevance of something to their life now, they are much more likely to learn it and remember it. This can be encouraged by appropriately designed classes I think, however it also requires the students to want to learn to a certain extent. I am not sure if any of this will help with a student who is only interested in 'passing' a course and not learning from it."
43,Vidhyasaharan Sethu,annotation,This is a valuable point and I think is sometimes skimmed over (almost subconsciously). Being passionate and entertaining are very often encouraged - to engage better with students. However it is important to remember the they are means to an end - better learning.
44,Vidhyasaharan Sethu,annotation,"Yes, students are more likely to learn if they are engaged in a suitable activity relevant to what is being taught. However, this may not always be possible. Some issues may be a very large class, or suitable equipment may not be available at university (too big, too expensive, too dangerous, etc.), concepts are too abstract (pure mathematics). In such cases what may be a suitable alternative?"
45,Vidhyasaharan Sethu,comment,"Both videos talk about engaging students to make them learn. This one also makes the important point about how being passionate and entertaining is secondary to the ultimate goal of educating the students. I think many people, myself included, often think engaging the students automatically leads to effective learning - perhaps it's valuable to empirically test this one in a while in every class!"
46,Dianne Anagnos,comment,"I completely agree with the fundamental position that the passive lecture style learning is not engaging and is not effective in promoting lifelong learning.  I'm lucky in that I get to refer to my students' practical learning experience during our classes.  This means that we can use their own concrete experiences. Simulation activities are incredibly useful, however they may be difficult to co-ordinate with a large group in limited time."
47,Mark Reed,comment,simulation is a good way to put it into practice and see how it works - in engineering this is done through labs and tutorials normally but perhaps some of this could be adopted into the lectures too.
48,Forrest Duxbury,annotation,That is a true point. Curriculum which doesn't tie effectively into real life practice will not be useful for the student in the long term.
49,Forrest Duxbury,annotation,But when does being a dispassionate bored teacher achieve engagement and effective learning?
50,Forrest Duxbury,comment,"Susan sounds very confident and experienced. I appreciate that her teaching style will encourage deep learning, but as she mentioned not all students will not necessarily support her teaching style as they are not as confident as she is with public speaking and group work. But.. this could be used to impart that. I could imagine students being isolated within their groups, within the loud busy room, or in the public demonstration wishing for this to be over, becoming increasingly disengaged."
51,Ben Silverstein,annotation,I completely agree with the point on relevance to students' lives - teaching something students can relate to their knowledge or experience makes it much more useful and memorable. They are more likely to continue to think about it after class!
52,Ben Silverstein,annotation,"This practical simulation exercise seems really useful. Theory and critique is essential, but you can theorise so much better once you've got some experience in trying to produce yourself. It gives an insight into a practice or a social institution that is substantial on another level."
53,Ben Silverstein,comment,"The approach detailed in this video seemed a great way to engage students as learners in a range of ways, from locating material in relation to their lives and experiences to organising simulations in class so they can practice what they&rsquo;re learning. These modes of engagement seem well developed for students to remember and keep thinking about what they&rsquo;ve learnt once they leave the classroom!"

57,Jiabao Yi,comment,"The method is suitable for sociationl science, may not be used in science and engineering. It is a good way to let the student learning with simulation. However, it will take a lot of time for such simulation. Can the required content be taught completely?"
58,Anton Kolotilin,annotation,Her teaching philosophy is not for school but for life. She wants students to be able to apply in real life what she teaches.
59,Anton Kolotilin,comment,It is important to have an active approach to teaching where they can apply theoretical knowledge acquired in class in practice in group activities.
60,Yun Hau Ng,comment,The students are more likely to be engaged if they are involved in some sort of simulation environment or case study. I am very interested in finding opportunities to implement this in my class.
61,Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz,annotation,This is something I use as well. I believe that by connecting a concept to the actual &ldquo;life&rdquo; makes it easier to get students engaged.
62,Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz,comment,"I think the key concept here is ""learn by practice/experience"".  I believe that by connecting a concept to activities normally encountered in everyday life, even if it is a simulated activity,  makes it easier to get students engaged and learn."
63,Fiona Hilferty,annotation,"Susan Banki's teaching philosophy aspires to deep learning - so that student's can apply the knowledge and skills that they learn to different contexts throughout their life. As Toohey states, this latter stage of learning can be achieved in a university context but it is challenging and requires teachers to prepare and think about more than lectures."
64,Fiona Hilferty,annotation,"At this point, Susan is describing life-long learning as a transferable skill (like critical thinking and problem solving). She wants her students to be engaged in the learning process, apply skills and content in other contexts, and be keen to learn more."
65,Fiona Hilferty,annotation,"I like Susan's reminder her that a teacher's passion for their subject is alone not enough to improve student's learning outcomes. This requires hard work and thoughtful preparation by the teachers that takes into account multiple factors such as students' learning styles, types of learning activities etc."
66,Fiona Hilferty,comment,"This video is a reminder of the hard work and innovative thinking often required to ensure that students connect with material, especially applying theoretical material in a practical way. Susan describes a number of teaching activities that she has used in her class, as well as the qualities that she believes are essential in a good teacher - humility, confidence, creativity, hard work, passion for subject. I would like to trial some of her ideas in my own teaching context (particularly the idea of setting activites around a made up scenario), but she cautions that these activities need to be based upon the needs of your own students."
67,Peyman Mostaghimi,comment,One of the most efficient way of teaching would be design some activities for students to exercise the theories they have learnt.
68,Klara Bruveris,annotation,"it is important to remind students how what they are doing in class is applicable to the outside world, not just scholarly material but also how they learn that material and engage with it"
69,Klara Bruveris,annotation,engagement and passion from the lecturer does not translate to meeting learning outcomes for students
70,Klara Bruveris,annotation,how to apply theory practically in class.
71,Klara Bruveris,comment,This video reminds me of my own teaching philosophy and the ways I try and engage my students in the course material. It is a good video to summarise the overall idea for this course.
