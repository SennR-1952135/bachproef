NGOs include foundations, co-operative societies, trade unions, and ad-hoc entities set up to collect funds for a specific purpose. NGO umbrella organisations and NGO networks are also included. NGOs should only be classified as international when: (i) either there is an international coordinating body facilitating the work of its members on the international level or the NGO has an extensive network of country/regional offices in the field;  (ii) and the NGO has internationally diversified sources of revenue."
