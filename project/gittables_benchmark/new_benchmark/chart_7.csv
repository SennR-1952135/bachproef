0,Percentage Bar,"Percentage Bar charts represents a single superset of data, with each subset being visualised as a percentage section of area of the bar. All sections of the bar add up to 100%. Like all other one dimensional charts, percentage bar charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
1,Line,"Line charts are used to depict a set of data points ('markers') connected by line segments (straight or smooth) in order to show the change in data points value (usually measured with the Y axis) over a fixed range of ordinal or interval data (time, date, increasing temperature, etc. measured with the X axis). A line chart is primarily used to establish and/or analyse behaviour trend of data with respect to changing ordinal or interval data",Multi Dimensional Charts
2,Multi-series Line,Sometimes we wish to visualise the trend based behaviour of several data sets against a common ordinal/ interval data range. In such cases a multi-series line offers insight into both the trend behaviour and comparison between trend behaviour for different data sets,Multi Dimensional Charts
3,Panel of Lines,"If we wish to visualise more than 4-5 line charts, putting all of them int a single chart causes it to quickly become cluttered. In such a situation it serves us best to create panels of single line charts that allows us to prevent excessive clutter and still derive the relevant insights from the data sets",Multi Dimensional Charts
4,Bar,"Bar charts utilise sets of horizontal rectangular segments with lengths proportional to the magnitude of data they represent. They may be used to represent and compare nominal/categorical or ordinal data. Bar charts can be seen as a simplification of histograms. While histograms are used to represent continuous data sets, bar charts are used to represent discrete data sets",Multi Dimensional Charts
5,Grouped Bar,"A grouped bar chart is great when you have multiple data sets of a similar nature and wish to visualise all of them against an ordinal or categorical data range on a single chart. Just like a simple bar chart, the magnitude of data is visualised in terms of the length of the horizontal rectangular bars",Multi Dimensional Charts
6,Column,Column charts are similar to bar charts. The only difference is that they use vertically oriented rectangular segments to represent the magnitude of data they represent (in terms of length of the rectangular segments). They may be used to represent and compare nominal/categorical or ordinal data,Multi Dimensional Charts
7,Grouped Column,Grouped Column Charts are used to represent multiple data sets as vertical columns grouped over an ordinal or categorical data range on a single chart. The magnitude of data being visualised is proportional to length of the rectangular column segments,Multi Dimensional Charts
8,Area,"Area charts are similar to line charts wherein a set of data points ('markers') are connected by line segments (straight or smooth) in order to show the change in data points value. However, they offer insight not only into the trend behaviour of the data being visualised, but also allow one to see the area under the curve/line segments. This is especially useful when both the data represented by the line and the area carved out by the line offer important insight into the data set (such as when representing cumulative totals over time)",Multi Dimensional Charts
9,Stacked Area,Stacked area charts allows one to visualise multiple area charts on a single plot. This allows for comparison between trend behaviour and area under the line/curve for multiple datasets. Stacked area charts are similar to multi-line series but offer an additional data insight in the form of area carved out under the line segment/curve,Multi Dimensional Charts
10,Scatter,"Multidimensional Scatter charts offer a method to visualise and compare datasets across 3 parameters – 2 being represented by the X and Y co-ordinates of the plotted circle and the area of the circle itself which represents the magnitude of data along another parameter. Colour of the scatter/circles offer an additional data insight, by allowing users to group data points into the data set to which they belong.",Multi Dimensional Charts
11,Panel of Scatters,"When comparing scatter plots for several data sets, doing so in a single chart may make the chart too cluttered and hence difficult to read. In order to alleviate this problem, one can use a panel of scatter charts. Each panel is a scatter chart in its own right offering data of upto 3 parameters – X & Y co-ordinates and area of the scatter circle.",Multi Dimensional Charts
12,Spider,"The spider chart is called so because it looks like the web of a spider. It consists of a sequence of equi-angular spokes, called radii, with each spoke representing one of the variables. The data being represented is visualised as points/circles on these spokes/radii, with the distance of the point from the centre being proportional to the relative magnitude of the data. A line is used to connect the points/circles on different radii in order to group data points into their respective data sets. It is best used when one wishes to visualise several data sets on a single chart and compare the data sets on 5-8 different variables/parameters",Multi Dimensional Charts
13,Pulse,"Pulse charts are a variation of scatter charts in which the scatter circles are plotted against primarily nominal/categorical and/or ordinal parameters serving as X and Y axes. As a result of this choice of axes, no two circles overlap and the chart is visualised as a grid of circles. The circle is further used to represent a third dimension of data, with the area of the circle depicting the magnitude of the data.",Multi Dimensional Charts
14,Pie,"Pie charts are one of world's most commonly used data visualizations. These are best used with similar and comparable data that can be represented as portions in a whole. The size/area of each wedge is used to represent the magnitude of the data being visualised. Ideally, pie charts should depict no more than 5 wedges. Abiding by good design principles, all one dimension charts including pie allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
15,Donut,"Donut charts are similar to pie charts in that they help represent data as portions of a whole. Additionally, they allow one to provide a total sum of all data portions based on which the portions have been determined. On the other hand, donut charts are sometimes harder to read if portions are of similar sizes. Hence, it is necessary to ensure that the portions are well-labeled. Like pie charts, donut charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
16,Semi Pie,"Semi pie/ election pie charts serve a comparable role to pie charts but their use is primarily well-known for charting out election results and parliamentary seat distribution. They primarily show how comparable data may be represented as portions of a half pie. Like pie charts, semi pie charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
17,Semi Donut,"Semi donut charts are very similar to semi pie charts that represent comparable data as portions of a half donut. Again, like semi-pie chart their use is most well know for charting out election results and also allow one to provide the total of portions forming the semi-donut. Like all other one dimensional charts, semi donut charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
18,Pyramid,"A pyramid or percentage triangle chart uses areas of sections of a triangle in order to communicate relative proportions/magnitude of data sets. It is best used to visualise data sets that have a single hierarchical relationship with each data set being typically a superset of data sets that are located higher up the pyramid than itself. Like all other one dimensional charts, pyramid charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
19,1D Bubble,"One dimensional bubble charts are used to show comparable data sets as a cluster of circles ('bubbles'). The area of these circles is used to communicate the relative comparison in terms of data value between the displayed data sets. Like all other one dimensional charts, 1D bubble charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
20,Treemap,"A treemap or percentage rectangle chart uses the areas of rectangles to show relative proportions/ magnitude of one dimensional data sets. It works well if the data being visualised has some for of hierarchical structure – with parent nodes, children, etc. Like all other one dimensional charts, treemaps allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
21,Funnel,"A funnel chart is used to represent data sets in a single hierarchy with the sections of the funnel communicating relative proportions/ magnitude of data sets. Typically, funnel charts communicate some kind of flow or filter process with each data set being a subset of the data set preceding it in the funnel. Like all other one dimensional charts, funnel charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
22,Percentage Column,"Percentage Column charts represents a single superset of data, with each subset being visualised as a percentage section of area of the column. All sections of the column add up to 100%. Like all other one dimensional charts, percentage column charts allow for only a single colour to be used for all segments and only upto one specific segment to be highlighted in a different colour/hue",One Dimensional Charts
23,Grid,Grid,Grid
24,Choropleth,"Choropleth are map charts that use several colours or a single colour with various saturations in order to represent a data set over a geographical map. They provide a snapshot of how magnitude of data varies by geographic location, the magnitude of data being represented by the variation in saturation or hues of colours. Choropleth maps are best used when one wishes to provide a snapshot for a fixed/static moment in time",Map Charts
