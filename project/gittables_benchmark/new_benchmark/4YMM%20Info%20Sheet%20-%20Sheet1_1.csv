And sorry I could not ride them both,
I briefly paused and took in the scene
Then chose the Yoshi whose hide was green,
And left the red with a solemn oath:

That I shall travel and then return
To ride the fiery one as well,
For it was anxious to have its turn
And use its power to breathe and burn,
But could not swallow a koopa shell,

And both that morning equally lay
In eggs that opened as I drew near.
Oh, lament the one that I sent away!
For in its eyes I could see dismay,
And loneliness was its greatest fear.

A plumber's promise is not a lie,
As indecision becomes remorse:
Two Yoshis hatched on a Switch, and I—
I'll surely give them both a try,
And that is how I shall clear the course.
