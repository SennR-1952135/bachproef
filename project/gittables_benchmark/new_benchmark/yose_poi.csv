59,"This waterfall is located on the south side of Yosemite Valley, just west of Sentinel Rock. It is comprised of multiple cascades, which range in height from 50 - 500 feet.

You can see this waterfall from areas along Southside Drive near the Sentinel Beach Picnic Area, and near the Four Mile Trailhead. Alternatively, you can view it from across Yosemite Valley near Leidig Meadow, or while hiking the Upper Yosemite Fall Trail.",景点,
60,"Flows: all year, with peak flow in May.

Relatively few people visit Hetch Hetchy Valley to see this roaring waterfall. In some springs, the water from this fall flows over the footbridges near its base.

You can see this waterfall from the parking lot at O’Shaughnessy Dam or you can hike on an uneven trail to near its base (see a list of Hetch Hetchy day hikes).",景点,
61,"El Capitan is a favorite for experienced rock climbers. Rising more than 3,000 feet above the Valley floor, it is the largest monolith of granite in the world. El Capitan is opposite Bridalveil Fall and is best seen from the roads in western Yosemite Valley, including Tunnel View, Bridalveil Fall area, and El Capitan Meadow.",景点,
62,"Tunnel View provides one of the most famous views of Yosemite Valley. From here you can see El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall rising from Yosemite Valley, with Half Dome in the background. This viewpoint is at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel along the Wawona Road (Highway 41).",景点,
63,"Devils Postpile National Monument is a unique geologic feature, formed by an eruption of basalt lava over 100,000 years ago. The lava cooled uniformly, leaving surface cracks and resulting in thousands of vertical basalt columns. Downstream from Devils Postpile National Monument are the amazing Rainbow Falls. Falling over a sharp 101-foot drop, Rainbow Falls sends colorful rainbows in the mist. The best time to experience the rainbows in midday, when the sun is highest. Scenic shuttle bus is mandatory and is fee based. ",景点,

75,"优胜美地瀑布（Yosemite falls），是北美洲落差最大的瀑布，位于美国加州内华达山脉，属于优胜美地国家公园，其最壮观的季节在春末，水量充沛，气势惊人。又译为约塞米蒂瀑布。 优胜美地瀑布全高为739米（2425呎），一共可分为三段，瀑布的落差距离排名世界第六，虽然在外观看来仅有上优胜美地瀑布与下优胜美地瀑布两段，但事实上包括了中间的落差地带，这三段分别是：
436米（1,430英尺）高的上优胜美地瀑布（又称“大优胜美地瀑布”），这一段瀑布独自的高度已可列入全世界20个最高瀑布当中，有数条从优胜美地谷地，或是外部山区的登山步道可达此瀑布的顶端或底部，主要的水源来自鹰溪平原（Eagle Creek Meadow）支流：优胜美地溪（Yosemite Creek），多个水道在此汇集，并自峭壁顶端猛烈冲击而下，造成了上优胜美地瀑布。
在上下两瀑布之间的落差区，有几个小潭，一般称此区为湍流区（the cataracts）。这一区的高度有675呎，差不多是下优胜美地瀑布的两倍高度，因为地理上的外观阻碍，这一块区域不容易全部看到，入口也很难被发现，最佳的观看角度是在往上优胜美地瀑布的步道上自己寻找可见的角度。国家公园对此区亦有特别警告，对喜好攀岩者，此区的风险必须自负，如需搜救行动，因地形难达，所以花费甚多。
下优胜美地瀑布（也称小优胜美地瀑布）高有320英尺（98米），有相当容易的步道可达（轮椅亦可），因此往往是游客最多的地方，优胜美地溪到此往默塞德河流去，如同该山区的其他溪流，优胜美地溪在这里产生了许多激流和乱流，整个地形也相当潮湿与湿滑。
在降雪量比较少的年份，优胜美地瀑布在夏末或秋初就因水量减少而逐渐消失，此时往往有攀岩者趁机挑战从岩面攀登而上，此举在突如其来的午后雷阵雨中，是相当冒险的，瀑布可能突然出现，水量足以将攀岩者冲落。
下优胜美地瀑布可从优胜美地旅馆旁的步道到达，上优胜美地瀑布则需由向阳营地Sunnyside Campground的入口进入，此步道相当陡峭、险峻、不少路段亦相当粗糙、容易滑倒，来回行程长度是6.4英里（10.3千米），落差达2,700英尺（820米），预计来回行程要花6～8小时。其他通往上优胜美地的步道，主要是由北方的Tioga Road前来。",景点,
76,"Flows: approximately March through June, with peak flow in May.

You can see Ribbon Fall from the road as you drive into Yosemite Valley, just beyond the turn for Bridalveil Fall (parking is available in turnouts).",景点,
77,"Flows: all year, with peak flow in late May.

While many hikers notice this waterfall as they're hiking toward Vernal Fall, the best place to see it is on the Panorama Trail, a few miles from Glacier Point (see a list of Valley day hikes). This waterfall is not visible from any road; it's only visible by hiking on steep trails.",景点,
78,"Flows: all year, with peak flow in May

This waterfall, located in Wawona, hides behind twists and turns in the rock; it's impossible to see the entire fall at the same time.

You can't see this waterfall from a road; the only way to see the fall is to hike to its top via a steep trail (see a list of Wawona day hikes).",景点,
79,"Flows: all year, with peak flow in May.

This is often the first waterfall visitors see when entering Yosemite Valley. In spring, it thunders; during the rest of the year, look for its characteristic light, swaying flow.

You can see Bridalveil Fall from near the tunnels on the Wawona Road (Highway 41) or Big Oak Flat Road (Highway 120) and from a signed parking lot on your way into Yosemite Valley. You can walk to the base via a short but steep (up to 24% slope) trail in just a few minutes.",景点,
80,"Half Dome is perhaps the most recognized symbol of Yosemite. Rising nearly 5,000 feet above the Valley floor, it is one of the most sought-after landmarks in Yosemite. Some people even hike or rock-climb to the top!

You can see Half Dome throughout much of eastern Yosemite Valley, including on the road between Yosemite Village and Yosemite Lodge and roads near Curry Village. Mirror Lake, while not really a lake, is a popular place to see Half Dome from up close. It's a two-mile round-trip walk on a paved trail with a 6.6% to 10.6% grade. (Cars displaying an accessibility placard can drive to near Mirror Lake; see the park's accessibility guide for details.)",景点,
81,"Flows: all year, though by mid to late summer, it narrows and separates into one, two, or three falls as water flows decrease; peaks in late May.

You can see Vernal Fall (from a distance) at Glacier Point. The road to Glacier Point is open approximately late May through sometime in November. A wheelchair-accessible trail is available to the viewpoint when the road is open.

",景点,
82,"Flows: all year, with peak flow in late May.

You can see Nevada Fall (from a distance) at Glacier Point. The road to Glacier Point is open approximately late May through sometime in November. A wheelchair-accessible trail is available to the viewpoint when the road is open.

You can also hike beyond Vernal Fall to Nevada Fall on a steep trail",景点,
83,Mirror Lake (in Yosemite Valley) is famous for its reflections of Half Dome and Mount Watkins when the water level is high enough (in spring); it's more a pond than a lake.,景点,
84,"Mariposa Grove & Museum - The Mariposa Grove, near Yosemite's South Entrance, contains about 500 mature giant sequoias. Giant sequoias are perhaps the largest living things on Earth.

Although the oldest giant sequoias may exceed 3,000 years in age, some living specimens of the ancient bristlecone pine (found in the mountains east of Yosemite and at Great Basin National Park in Nevada, among other places) are more than 4,600 years old. The tallest trees are the giant sequoia's cousin—the coast redwood, which you can see at Muir Woods National Monument and Redwood National Park, among others. 

To get there: The two-mile Mariposa Grove Road is open from approximately April through November. When open, you can drive to the grove from Yosemite's South Entrance (off of Highway 41). During summer, however, the small parking lot fills frequently, resulting in periodic road closures. So, it's best to take the free Wawona-Mariposa Grove shuttle. When the road is closed during winter, you can still walk, snowshoe, or ski up the road from South Entrance (two miles with about 500 feet of elevation gain).",景点,
85,"Ostrander Lake - Ostrander Lake is located in Yosemite National Park, approximately 10 miles south of Yosemite Valley and 10 miles east of the Badger Pass Ski Area, at an elevation of 8,500 feet. The lake is a popular destination for cross-country skiers during the winter. It is the primary source of Bridalveil Creek, which feeds Bridalveil Falls.

The hike to Ostrander Lake is a long and strenuous 12.7 miles (20.4 km) roundtrip hike starting from the trailhead located just after Bridalveil Creek on the Glacier Point road.[2] The hike begins with a fairly level path through an extensive burned over and regrowth area, with both shaded and sunny areas. The second half of the hike climbs, steeply at times, over 1,500 feet (460 m) in elevation in about 3 miles. Hikers will have a nice view of Clark Range before dropping down to the north shore of the lake. Several excellent campsites can be found on the west side of the lake, particularly on the benches overlooking the rocky ridge that forms the eastern shore backdrop. Fishing is fair for 10-12"" rainbow trout. 

In the summer, the lake is a great backpacking destination because the ski hut is unoccupied but its presence keeps away the hordes of hikers looking for a ""wilderness"" destination. The lake is named for a descendant of Alexander Ostrander (1783) of Smithfield NY. This branch of Ostrander family settled in Colorado (Georgetown, Granby, Hot Sulphur Springs, Golden) prior to 1872, and some moved from Colorado to California.",景点,
