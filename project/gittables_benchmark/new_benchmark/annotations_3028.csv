0,Sonia Graham,annotation,How do we develop ways of hearing what students are learning? I like this way of re-thinking student engagement. It resonates with some reading I was doing on peer feedback and marking yesterday.
1,Sonia Graham,annotation,Tests are about determining what you taught well to whom. Surely we should see teaching and learning as a two-way relationship. This would mean tests are about determining how well your teaching intersected with students' learning and identifying students with whom you might need to work on improving your teaching-learning relationship.
2,Sonia Graham,annotation,A world of difference between an activator and a facilitator
3,Sonia Graham,annotation,It's easy to assume students in one class are basically the same as the students in the next class and that the content only requires minor modification. A very passive approach to teaching that is unlikely to facilitate deep learning.
4,Sonia Graham,annotation,Need to develop interpersonal trust between students and between the students and the teach. This requires development of a culture of trust. If students can say they don't know this is the ultimate test of trust.
5,Sonia Graham,annotation,"The only way teaching works is if you can reflect on what happens in the classroom, not just the 30% that you observe as a teacher."
6,Sonia Graham,annotation,What feedback did you get today?
7,Sonia Graham,comment,"This video talks about the importance of feedback for helping both teachers and students by making learning visible. Feedback works best when students don't know how they've gone. Teaching works best when it involves regular feedback. Hence, John asks his sons each day, what feedback did you get today?In order to make feedback honest and effective there needs to be a culture of trust. It also requires teachers to be active and desire to be a change agent in the classroom."
8,Heath Pratt,annotation,Feedback works best when the student doesn't know how they have gone.  This is a simple concept but so true and is so easily forgotten. It provides the ability for deep learning to occur as the student applies the concepts and can adapt those concepts.
9,Heath Pratt,annotation,"In contrast to feedback to the student, evaluation activities are feedback to the teachers."
10,Heath Pratt,annotation,how important is evaluating the effects of teaching!
11,Heath Pratt,annotation,"The attitude of the teacher is what makes teachers effective change mediums. It is the attitude towards their reflections and evaluation as it reflects on their teaching approach, what works and wha doesn't work that makes them more effective teachers and change managers."
12,Heath Pratt,annotation,The class student/teacher relationships about building trust. It is about establishing a rapport with the students so they can admit their knowledge shortfalls and feedback can be more effective in breaching those shortfalls.
13,Heath Pratt,annotation,"Classrooms where error is tolerated, welcomed is a classroom where learning occurs."

16,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,A teacher's fundamental job is to evaluate your instruction and its effectiveness
17,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,tests are there for teachers evaluate how well they have taught their cohort
18,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Teachers as change agents - this mind set makes a difference. Offer difference rather than more to meet the learners' needs.
19,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Teachers' attitude/mindset impact the effectiveness of their teaching more than content knowledge &amp; strategies

23,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Importance of building trust to enable honest feedback
24,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Learning occurs where error is welcomed
25,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Evidence- based teaching is gathering info on what you can do better
26,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,70% of what happens in the classroom is missed by the teacher.  Need evidence of this 70% so it can be included in the teachers' reflections
27,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Make learning visible to the teacher
28,Fiona Nicolson,comment,Hattie emphasizes the importance of making learning visible to the teacher before the teacher reflects on the effectiveness of their teaching. He claims that the teacher's attitude and mindset as a change agent impacts more on the effectiveness of their teaching than their content knowledge or strategies. He also encourages teachers to challenge students rather than simply cover the curriculum. Hattie is very thought provoking - especially focussing on the power of the teacher in a learner centred classroom.

33,Omar Hussain,annotation,challenge students
34,Omar Hussain,annotation,important to have that ability if the teacher wants to be adaptable to what the students say. But how?
35,Omar Hussain,comment,Key points mentioned:1. Don't go over the course content. Challenge them2. Regularly evaluate your teaching.3. Build trust with students to get feedback.4. Give feedback. 5. Get an understanding or feedback of your teaching by asking.Would like to know a bit more on how to do points 1 and 2.

38,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,
39,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,It is important to build trust in whole class
40,Abrar Chughtai,comment,"Prof John discussed various aspects of teaching mindset and role of teacher as leader, change agent, activator or facilitator. He mainly emphasized on getting evidence through actual feedback, not just routine data. He also discussed trust building not with the students but within whole class to prompt open discussion. Monitoring the progress of students and providing feedback is also important."

43,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,"When there's trust, there's learning"
44,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,Teachers are to collect evidence about themselves and reflect with the help of other teachers
45,Mariam Farida,annotation,"I found John Hattie's video very honest and straight to the point. it is hard to be a teacher and takes a lot of energy and dedication. the few points that I can take from his talk which I think are essential for teaching, and are what I try to keep note of are:1-the role of teachers as evaluators, that is teachers must know who the exams or activities they are giving are for, to know how to manage to give the students the assessments that reflect their knowledge2-for teachers to have a mindset to be realistic, and to propose challenging tasks so that students can be encouraged and supported. I try to reflect this in my classes, in which I always try to encourage students to think out of the box and maybe propose  research goals that gets them to ask big questions3- feedback is powerful, I agree with John, because teachers tend to go on with their routine without actually stopping and asking, am I doing the right thing? are students learning? but then feedback comes to answer that, peer evaluation or students' evaluation, or even informal students in class evaluation always helps, where you just have a chat with students ask them how they are going about with their studying. this can help a lot.4- another final point, is building the trust with the students, I remember I had a student last year where she wouldn't participate much but I can notice that she is interacting with the subject, so I approached her and asked her and then she had told me that she felt shy because she didn't want to look like a fool in class. I thanked her for sharing this and encouraged her to participate and that in this classroom all opinions are welcome and all errors are ok. we are here to learn. I was happy after that because she did participate and ended up with a distinction. so I think it is important to build the trust so that students will feel the good environment to share and learn!"
46,Mariam Farida,comment,"I think what John said was very honest and I agree with him on the following points:1-teachers must build trust with students so that a student can feel that they can make an error and that its ok because they are here to learn and they are not expected to know about everything2-teachers must not take evaluation for granted, it is always healthy to pause and ask/reflect if they teacher is doing everything right or if students are struggling with something3- teachers need to evaluate their own structures, exams, content..etc.. the course outcome must meet the student's abilities 4- teachers need to have a mindset to challenge students and encourage them to be active learners and to engage."
47,Anna Yeung,annotation,Being an active listener would be a handy skill in teaching.
48,Anna Yeung,annotation,"Getting away from the ""tests are for kids"" mindset - it is also a marker of how well the teacher has taught the content."
49,Anna Yeung,annotation,Love this point here - that you learn when you are challenged.
50,Anna Yeung,annotation,"Students should have the freedom to make mistakes, I think many of them are too afraid to speak."
51,Anna Yeung,comment,Challenging students encourages them to learn. Reflective teaching encourages the teachers to seek feedback and learn from those experiences.
52,Wen Hu,annotation,test is about the teachers
53,Wen Hu,annotation,Regularly seeking feedback
54,Wen Hu,annotation,building trust in the classroom is the foundation of the useful feedback and engagement.
55,Wen Hu,annotation,Lifelong learning: students become their own teachers
56,Wen Hu,annotation,Evidence is more important than data
57,Takuya Kojima,annotation,It is indeed difficult to listen to how students perceive the class. They do not really express their real feelings.
58,Takuya Kojima,annotation,teachers see themselves as evaluators.
59,Takuya Kojima,annotation,evaluation is not about kid's learning but about yourself
60,Takuya Kojima,annotation,teacher's job is to seek what is appropriately challenging for students
61,Colin Clark,annotation,Students taking responsibility for their own learning seems a key point - perhaps tutors should reflect on how to engender self-efficacy.
62,Colin Clark,annotation,Interesting point - your fundamental job is to evaluate your instruction and your effects.
63,Colin Clark,annotation,"I wonder if this is not just a question of preferred jargon? Maybe he means ""developing"" and ""emerging"" involves a passive process of waiting for students to change themselves."
64,Colin Clark,annotation,He seems to see feedback as a task-focused activity - could it not also be affective/encouragement? Especially for the school children he seems to be talking about.
65,Colin Clark,annotation,Build trust before kids admit they don't know.
66,Colin Clark,annotation,70% of what happens n classroom the teacher does not see
67,Colin Clark,annotation,It would be useful if he would provide a couple of more specific examples of what he means.
68,Colin Clark,comment,"Certainly the use of evidence-based methods is important, and it applies at the individual level as well as the institutional one. However, formative evaluation should not be mixed with performance appraisals. That gives an incentive to avoid difficult questions."
69,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"""Feedback is powerful when you do not know"". I like this concept which I interpret as students feedback is very important and as important is to know how to identify situations in which feedback is more meaningful."
70,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"To create a relation with the students and also that the students create relationships between them in order to allow anyone to express freely, is a nice concept that may be useful in the primary stages of education. I find this, however, not to be necessary at other more advanced stages like, for instance, university level."
71,Claudio Cazorla Silva,comment,"""Feedback is powerful when you do not know"". I like this concept. I interpret it as that students feedback is very important but also is very important is to learn to identify the situations in which feedback can be more meaningful.To create a relation with the students and also that the students create relationships between them in order to allow anyone to express freely, is a nice concept that may be useful in the primary stages of education. I find this, however, not to be necessary at other more advanced stages like, for instance, university level.In my opinion, there is clearly a need for differentiating between teacher's attitudes and strategies depending on the context in which the learning activity takes place. At the university level, at which I work, I think other aspects like for instance being proficient on the topics that you explain, is by far more important than, for instance, creating a relationship with students. In order to define good teaching strategies or attitudes, I think that one necessarily must consider the context in which the related activities are going to take place."
72,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,The importance of listening to students
73,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,Students' success depends on the teacher&rsquo;s ability to communicate new knowledge and engage students.
74,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,"Feedback works better when it's difficult, there is no point otherwise"
75,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,"A good teacher student relationship, based on trust is important"
76,David Silvera Tawil,comment,"It is important to take responsibility as a teacher. Lack of engagement and learning can be improved by taking responsibility, building trust and creating a good learning environment."
77,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This is a very empowering view of teaching. It is a lot more motivating to look at this practice as something that we can naturally shape on the basis of our awareness of a particular teaching environment, understanding of students' needs, as well as in connection to our own skills."
78,Corey Martin,annotation,What are ways that teachers and actually hear what students are learning. I.e. what is going on in their minds.
79,Corey Martin,annotation,The fundamental job of teaching is to evaluate the teachers instruction.
80,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This is an important point, which I think is also useful to re-think our CATEI survey. The adoption of a standard questionnaire to courses that are so different from one another in terms of discipline, activities, student demographic, topics discussed, etc. etc. is questionable in my view. At times, a more tailored type of feedback is need from students, so that we can better understand what we are doing and how we are doing it."
81,Corey Martin,annotation,Testing focus should be back on the teacher NOT so much on the student. i.e. how well did the teacher communicate the learning?
82,Corey Martin,annotation,Types of different approaches to teaching.
83,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This concept of trust that the speaker presents here is definitely the ideal scenario of the relationship a teacher would like to have with his/her students. I am wondering how many of us are able to get to that... I find that I am more able to build that trust, somehow, with a small number of students within a class/ i can that get some honest comments from them. They know that I value their observations and their honesty does not carry negative consequences of any kind. Perhaps this could be built with very small classes."
84,Valentina Bau,comment,"What the speaker emphasises throughout his talk is the importance of gathering that feedback, which is useful for teaching evaluation, while at the same time providing some back to students. I agree that this process is important for an effective teaching practice. The challenge is how to build that into the course, curriculum and class dynamics that often characterise each individual course."
85,Corey Martin,annotation,"Teachers who challenge students have better outcomes over those who just want to cover the curriculum and allow students to ""do their best""."
86,Corey Martin,annotation,Attitude needs more passion and time
87,Corey Martin,annotation,"Need to build trust with both individuals and between peers to create a ""safe"" environment.Ask students the question: What would happen if you don't know the answer?"
88,Corey Martin,annotation,Need to tolerate errors and welcome this to encourage the most learning.
89,Corey Martin,comment,Helpful to be direct and confront students in a way that actively seeks evidence-based feedback to improve teaching.
90,Freda Passam,comment,Prof John Hattie on this clip is an active and passionate teacher. I also agree with his points that you need time and strategy to prepare for teaching and you need to request feedback.
91,Kelly Royds,comment,What feedback did you get today? I like how Hattie looks at both teacher/learner as having similar sets of responsibilities for learning and reflection. I also agree with the idea that the trend of highlighting certain strategies and buzzwords over attitude and approach is problematic.
92,Till Boecking,annotation,Hattie proposes viewing exam outcomes as a measure of teacher success rather than student success
93,Till Boecking,annotation,Trust as a requirement for honest and meaningful feedback; feedback as a driver for teaching
94,Till Boecking,comment,"Hattie's main point is that the teacher needs to have a particular mindset or attitude towards teaching to be successful. In partiuclar, he propses that teache should constantly evaluate their student's progress and from that determine how to adjust teaching methods. This requires building trust to be able to obtain meaningful feedback."
95,Amy Teale,annotation,Importance of listening skills in a teacher
96,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Evaluate your progress as a teacher. Assessments are not just a way to allocate grades to students.
97,Jaz Lawes,comment,Mindset and attitudes are integral in successful teaching. It is important to continually measure your success as an educator. Be mindful people!
98,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Activator verses Facilitator. Activate learning to encourage independent learning by students.
99,Amy Teale,annotation,Feedback most powerful for more difficult tasks
100,Amy Teale,annotation,These are critical to getting true feedback
101,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Building trust to enable free-verbalisation between teachers and students in a group environment is key to engaging students. Students need to feel comfortable to say they do not know the answer in front of those peers.
102,Amy Teale,comment,Hattie has some interesting points about the role of teachers in gathering feedback. I agree that it is vital to build a good relationship with students to elicit genuine feedback. The focus on continually reevaluating what you as a teacher does is also important.
103,Hossein Masoumi,comment,Really interesting discussion but keen to see how in action these theories can be implemented particularly for non-social science courses.
104,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,The idea that we should move towards being about teachers and how well the information is getting across rather than students is very interesting
105,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"It was interesting what he said about jargon.  People start to focus on achieving preconceived ideas, but not really thinking about the objectives of a particular course, let alone program."
106,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,The idea of an active teacher that wants change is one that really appeals to me. It seems like placing emphasis on changing and adapting can really influence students experience. This issue I have is that I am not sure the system is designed to allow this type of teacher at university level
107,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"There seems to be a motivation for collecting evidence.  But to show whom?  Perhaps in high schools it is important, but in universities the only evidence the schools want is in the form of formal evaluations, eg. CATEI.  Or is the evidence for ourselves?"
108,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"The idea of self-regulation of young people is interesting.  I have found that if young people are treated as if they have the ability and they are respected, they seem to perform better, i.e., they are performing to expectations."
109,Nicole Lasky,comment,"I like the idea of getting back to basics of focusing on what the students need to learn, are learning, and then adapting to them to help them learn, rather than focusing on jargon."
110,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I completely agree with the feedback point and it is one that I am very passionate in my own teaching. Feedback should be focused on constructive criticism designed to help them develop higher level skills apply knowledge. There is no point for feedback if it focuses entirely either on the easy things you have done correctly or likes and perhaps more importantly if there is no applicable structure/content to the feedback
111,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,"The concept of building trust with the entire class so that you can get honest feedback from students but also so that they allow each other to give that critical feedback is very rare but something that I have seen the benefits in my own teaching, on the occasions that it occurs"
112,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,comment,The points that most resonated with my in this clip is firstly that the feedback should be focused on actually helping the students improve. That classrooms where error is encouraged is something that I try to encourage in my classes and it has excellent consequences when I have managed to build the trust and students do feel comfortable questioning and discussing. Finally the idea of building trust so the students are comfortable with you and each other in order to allow this questioning is a very strong point
113,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,Absolutely love the point that classrooms which encourage error and questioning is what we should strive for. I strongly believe that questions are what drives deeper levels of learning.
114,Li Fu,annotation,Teacher as evaluation and change agent;Build trust relationship with students to collect evidence to reflect teaching.
115,Li Fu,comment,"I agree with Professor Hattie that teachers should have a mindset of teacher as evaluation and change agent.He suggests teacher should build trust relationship with student to collect evidence of students' learning, and use this to reflect teaching method and check student progress. It is helpful for me to reflect my teaching methods. But I am a little confused on what methods we can use to apply these theory to our teaching.Hope we can find further resource."
116,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,teachers are evaluators. Perhaps we should *only* be evaluators.
117,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"Feedback works powerfully when you don't know. I like it, so I wrote it down."
118,Julia Lappin,annotation,how do we help teachers hear how their students are learning
119,Julia Lappin,annotation,if you have the mindset that when the kids take the test it helps you evaluate what you managed to teach to whom
120,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,I like the evidence based approach. Good to know if you are doing something right.
121,Julia Lappin,annotation,feedback works powerfully when you don't know
122,Julia Lappin,annotation,classrooms where error occurs are classrooms where learning is happening
123,Julia Lappin,annotation,teachers asking and collecting evidence for themselves
124,Sanja Lujic,annotation,Aspire to be an 'activator' of knowledge not merely a messenger or 'facilitator'
125,Sanja Lujic,annotation,When should feedback be sought? Not during easy exercises or clear/simple concepts. Rather gather feedback when students are in doubt/don't know
126,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Effective feedback requires trust between students and lecturers, as well as the whole class. Only when the students feel they have a safe environment will they feel comfortable providing feedback."
127,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Teachers should be evaluators - collecting evidence of what's good/bad, what things to do differently"
128,Julie Thoms,annotation,How do we help teachers hear how students are learning?
129,Sanja Lujic,comment,"John Hattie's key points around making learning visible to teachers, collecting evidence on what happens in the classroom, determining how these impact on the effects (or effectiveness of teaching) resonate will within tertiary institutions as well. Feedback is an important driver of improving teaching , improving effectiveness, and making student experience a memorable one."
130,David Lyons,annotation,"""give students different rather than more"""
131,David Lyons,annotation,attitude more important than the resource
132,David Lyons,annotation,"""how am I going as a teacher"" requires trust to get an honest answer"
133,David Lyons,comment,So feedback from the students is important.  We only do this once a semester with CATEI.  Makes one wonder what students think of our teaching efforts the remainder of the time.
134,Catherine Ryan,annotation,Stop the talk! Allow students a voice in the classroom. Teachers may not always be the voice of authority on a topic.
135,Catherine Ryan,annotation,Tests are a mechanism to regurgitate content in a manner which is easy to mark. What does it really test?? Not whether a teacher is a good facilitator of knowledge.
136,Catherine Ryan,annotation,"Building trust with your students is very important, esp with Gen X Y Z. You will not have their trust just because you are their teacher."
137,Catherine Ryan,annotation,"It's OK to fail, should be encouraged. How else will they grow?"
138,Catherine Ryan,annotation,Timely effective feedback is the key to student learning.
139,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Interesting to look at tests from John Hattie's perspective- it is essentially teacher's evaluation on how well they taught and and what can be changed to facilitate better learning.
140,Catherine Ryan,comment,"The teaching profession has always struggled to share ideas, resources and teaching practices. Open the classrooms and open our minds to what's possible to evaluate and change our practices."
141,Julie Thoms,comment,"I think that the idea of tolerating error is very important &ndash; for the teacher as much as the student. It can be very easy to want to always get positive feedback, but as Hattie states, change comes in identifying what we are not doing very well. I also like the idea that it is in challenging situations that feedback becomes important, and even desired by the student. Finally, I agree that the mindset of the teacher is critical &ndash; as we progress through FULT it is increasingly obvious that good teaching requires a great deal of passion and commitment. This is particularly challenging in my own field where research is seen as the primary task (and really is what counts in terms of getting the grants which are required for ongoing employment) and teaching is typically an annoying extra task that is done in the minimal possible time."
142,Yue Huang,annotation,"The students become their own teachers. Teachers see themselves as evaluators. Who you teach well to whom. Mindset means to teachers. Teachers as change agents. Feedback works powerfully, when you do not know."
143,Yue Huang,comment,I like Prof. John Hattie's teaching style. It is so passionate and active. I fully agree with him.
144,Margarita Mandic,annotation,"I agree with the notion of building trust in the class in order to be able to ask questions, give feedback and constructive criticism from peers and educators."
145,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Indeed teachers must evaluate and reflect on their own teaching before evaluating students.
146,Margarita Mandic,annotation,I agree - it is important to build trust to create a safe non-judgemental environment for students to freely share feedback and ask questions.
147,Margarita Mandic,comment,Great talk by John Hattie. Main points for me were: -create positive environment in the classroom where error is encouraged and questions are welcomed.-Evaluate your own teaching and seek feedback from students-Create a challenge for students to propel forward and increase motivation.
148,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"""... hear how students are learning"". Interesting, if teaching is more about evaluation then listening to the students is vital."
149,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"When my students take a test, I'm being evaluated."
150,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,I'll need to find new ways of building trust.
151,Daniel Mansfield,comment,"This video is possibly the best thing in FULT. There are many points made here, but I want to focus on ""teachers as evaluators"". To evaluate our students, we need to see the learning, and respond to learning needs. This requires a great deal of interaction and effort - such dedication is frequently absent."
152,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Self regulation and being more observant to your teaching in the classroom is important.
153,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,The job of the teacher is to evaluate himself or herself
154,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,"Feedback works well when you don't know, when there is incredible challenge in the task"
155,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,A critical list of evaluating teachers:1. Being responsible2. Being change agents3. Gaining feedback4. Need to challenge5. Welcome error and build trust6. Assessment informs teachers
156,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,"Mindset of what a teacher does is much more important than what strategies, competencies, resources, tools etc. are used."
157,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Teachers who make the class challenging are more effective than those who think their job is to cover the curriculum and let the students do their best.
158,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Challenging teaching requires investment. Otherwise it's easy to take out last year's lessons.
159,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Got to build trust before students will admit they don't know
160,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Building trust with the whole class and the student is confident in saying I don't know.
161,Ateeq Rauf,comment,The talk sums up how important it is for teachers to use evidence favorably in evaluating and improving their own teaching. Also the message is for teachers to invest more time and energy into their teaching to challenge students and build relationships in the class to create an atmosphere that welcomes learning.
162,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"I like this idea, trying to stop talking at the students and listen to what they are learning. I've never really thought about evalution this way. I've always been more of a 'talker' asking the students if they have grasped the concepts rather than listening."
163,Samantha Furfari,annotation,This resonates with me because I have always felt that I learnt better from feedback on a tough question that I got wrong than on the easier stuff that I got right. I always want to challenge myself and my students. Bring them up to a certain level and give them the tools to do it
164,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"This also is a very true statement, we need a level of trust with the students so that they can critique our teaching without worrying about backlash"
165,Ria Arnold,comment,Very interesting talk. I liked the concepts of 'establishing what is appropriately challenging' rather than delivering the content and having a 'do your best' method of assessment.
166,Samantha Furfari,comment,"I really enjoying this video from Prof. Hattie. It has definitely made me think about what evidence that I use to evaluate my own teaching by listening to the students. I also think I will take some of these points into my next lot of teaching...how to build trust, the use of feedback and try to get a handle on how the students are progressing"
167,Rose Butler,annotation,"- to safely construct a discussion about teaching &amp; mindset of teaching- stress importance of principles behind structural evaluation - evaluate our instructions and affects rather than tests being about kids. -interesting reflections on feedback, which I hadn't thought of a lot before, especially when tasks are unknown - this relates well to our current case studies assessments.-the importance of building relationships in the classroom to develop trust about the whole class so they can express what they really think - this relates well in our current streams where the trust is vastly different between streams, for a range of reasons that we have been tackling-teachers/leaders as evaporators and emphasis on the attitude we bring to the classroom and collecting evidence that relates well to that. -Emphasis on evidence is very interesting (id like to learn more about this)-have learning intentions, success criteria and worry about progress (and give feedback frequently) as way to make my students' learning visible"

170,Natalie Ross,annotation,"The idea that evaluation is of and for the teacher makes it easier to think if it as distinct from assessment, because it is easy to blur the two"
171,Natalie Ross,annotation,I agree with Prof Hattie's statement that the teacher's mindset is really important. In all teaching settings with both children and adults the approach and attitude of the teacher makes a huge difference to the experiences of students and their learning.

173,Peter Nangle,annotation,Teachers as evaluators. It is easy to treat this as an optional item that gets lost when things get busy. If we don't evaluate how do we know how well we taught and how well what we taught was learnt.
174,Sarah Mulholland,annotation,Tests are assessment for learning for the teacher. To improve the teaching and learning cycles
175,Peter Nangle,annotation,Teachers need to be change agents - an important mindset. Mindset more powerful than content or strategy.
176,Sarah Mulholland,annotation,Different rather than more... important in special ed
177,Peter Nangle,annotation,Feedback works best when you don't know.
178,Shanaka Herath,annotation,The idea of building relationships with students resonates with me. I've had situations where I asked my class if they understood everything or if they had any questions. Now I know the reason why I sometimes didn't get good answers.
179,Sarah Mulholland,annotation,Does not like inquiry based learning
180,Carolien van Ham,comment,"I love this video! The idea that exams are evaluations of how well we are doing in promoting student learning, and the idea of us collecting evidence about our performance on an ongoing basis, creating trust in a class-room so that feedback can be given from students to teacher and vice versa, is very nice."
181,Sarah Mulholland,annotation,This requires a different mindset
182,Peter Nangle,comment,Hattie is always worth listeming to. His ideas as teachers as evaluators and that we need to evaluate what we don't know to get meaningful data. Mindset is more important that content knowledge or strategies.
183,Sarah Mulholland,annotation,"Building trust. Kids don't say they don't get it without trust. Important to build the trust with the whole class, so a student feels safe to say 'I don't know'"

186,Sarah Mulholland,comment,Much of what Hattie says is so important in education. He discusses the notion of differentiation and assessment for and of learning. Hattie says it is important that educators use assessment to inform the learning and teaching cycle.
187,Arash Khatamianfar,annotation,"It is a highly demanding skills and not all the students and even lecturers have this skill, considering the age of students your are working with."
188,Shanaka Herath,annotation,This actually changed the way I think about the tests - 'A	Test is an evaluation of what did you teach well to whom?'
189,Arash Khatamianfar,annotation,"It is true that the best feedback and evaluation is to give a challenging task to students but the students should feel that by what they are given in the class and a bit of extra work, they can succeed in the task, otherwise they would be discouraged."
190,Shanaka Herath,comment,This actually changed the way I think about the tests - 'A Test is an evaluation of what did you teach well to whom?'. This video also re-emphasized the need to build good relationships with students.
191,Arash Khatamianfar,annotation,"It is real fact, they have to trust to the lecturer and his ability and attitude."
192,Stephen Doherty,comment,"Excellent points on ""instructive evaluation"" rather than ""evaluation""."
193,Arash Khatamianfar,comment,"I can agree with most of his argument, but to be able to apply his points in the higher education environment, the schools and faculties should also be engaged and facilitate the implementation of better evaluation. To leave everything to the lecturer would discourage them to improve the teaching style."
194,Heath Pratt,comment,"I took away some interesting, and to be quite honest, crucial realisations as a result of watching the video. The video highlighted important issues that I had previously suspected but until now had not had specifically addressed in this way before. The realisation that evaluation is in fact a two way street is enlightening. It is just important, if not more important for the teacher than to the student. I found the video&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on the requirement for teachers to adopt a paradigm shift in order to see evaluation as feedback to the education deliverer and not just feedback for participating students.I also found the video refreshing as it encourages teachers to step out of their comfort zone before asking the student to step out of theirs. Hattie emphasises the fact that we learn just as much, if not more from our mistakes then from our successes. More specifically he challenges teachers to set evaluation that is challenging. He suggests that easy evaluation may undermine the learning experience for students and the development of their mental models that underpins deep learning. Both the teacher and the students should realise that effective feedback can take the form of both positive and negative reinforcement. Furthermore, the educational relationship should be one of trust upon which positive and negative reinforcement, in the form of feedback, is well received and it is then that the feedback becomes effective."
195,David Lyons,comment,evaluation a two-way street
196,David Lyons,comment,small groups of students collaborate well together
197,Mel Chavez,annotation,Teachers should evaluate the effectiveness of their own teaching
198,Mel Chavez,annotation,Tests are not really about kids but more about how well teachers taught well or not so well.
199,Mel Chavez,annotation,Interesting list of adjectives for 'An Activator' Vs 'A Facilitator'.
200,Mel Chavez,annotation,Feedback works powerfully when you don't know.
201,Mel Chavez,annotation,Teachers have to build trust before kids will admit that they don't know.
202,Mel Chavez,comment,"Prof. John Hattie discussed so many insightful key points about what makes an effective teacher, and his passion to make better teachers and challenge them is clearly demonstrated."
