8,Mariam Farida,annotation,"i found the flipped classroom interesting but i have not used this in my teaching yet. i have few comments in terms of:1-is reducing the time of the lecture from 50 minutes to 12-24 minutes good if i am teaching condensed material such as international law or international relations?2-will the flipped class technique work with teaching languages? i am interested to find out more 3-i found that what is suggested is very convenient with large classes, and i still teach small groups so it definitely gave me something to think about when i start teaching bigger classes4-finally, watching the video of the lecture is also convenient because students can fast forward or repeat something that wasn't 100% clear.i would want to learn more about flipped classes because i have not felt the need to use them yet, as my tutorials are small in size."
9,Mariam Farida,comment,i found the technique flipped classes interesting and i would be interested to learn more about it when it comes to using in in teaching languages.
10,Samantha Hornery,annotation,This amount of time for the video is a bit longer than other research suggests
11,Samantha Hornery,annotation,"I like the idea of a timekeeper and the photo - there are technology options here too, but the is great"
12,Samantha Hornery,comment,Good overview of an approach to a flipped classroom
13,Omar Hussain,annotation,key thing here --&gt; students need to watch
14,Omar Hussain,annotation,How is this different from a tutorial then? Is the aim to have just the flipped lectures and no tutorials?
15,Omar Hussain,annotation,good point - students do not get lost.
16,Omar Hussain,annotation,too much of assumption is on that the students have already watched the lecture video. This may not be the case always.
17,Omar Hussain,annotation,good point. But if the class is of 100 students - I as a lecturer may not be able to go to all the groups. This I can do easily in the small group tutorials that I do.
18,Omar Hussain,annotation,a problem can be dominating students who get the limelight at all times.
19,Omar Hussain,annotation,this is good as in the small tutorials only the small group of attendees are available for discussion.
20,Omar Hussain,comment,"Overall a good approach but:1. A prerequisite is for the students to do the learning first before this can be effective. 2. Another issue is if this is a big class, I would not be able to go to each group and pay attention to each student which I can do in a small tutorial group."
21,Sonia Graham,annotation,Students are expected to have already watched the video before coming to the class.My experience with providing recommended readings is that few students do the readings before coming to class. Are they more likely to watch a video? What happens to students who haven't watched the video beforehand?
22,Sonia Graham,annotation,I like that the flipped classroom provides opportunities for active engagement in large lecture settings.
23,Sonia Graham,annotation,"How do you make sure that all students actively participate from week to week and that it's not just the more confident students presenting?Also, I know that as a student I would have been mortified at the thought of presenting in front of a video camera. I found it hard enough to put my hand up in tutorials to answer questions, even if I'd done all the readings beforehand."
24,Sonia Graham,comment,"I can see that there are considerable benefits to a flipped classroom in terms of getting students to actively 'do' rather than passively 'listen' in large classroom settings. I can also see how this is likely to encourage deeper learning, especially among those students who are proactive about watching the videos beforehand. But I can also see how it might motivate students who might otherwise take a shallow approach to take a deeper approach.I'm unclear on whether it is expected that all lecture in a course are taught using this approach or just a few. It seems that a mixture of approaches might work best."
25,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,It is an interesting concept where you give students the possibility to apply their learning during the formal lecture
26,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,
27,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,
28,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,"Seems like the lectures are al in video, with the face-t-face sessions becoming tutorial-like sessions"
29,David Silvera Tawil,comment,It is an interesting concept where the face-to-face sessions are used only for questions and activities (like tutorials) and not for lectures. Lectures are then all online. I'm not sure if I'm 100% convinced.
30,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This sounds like a very interesting approach, and certainly a lot more fun and engaging, even for the lecturer!"
31,Valentina Bau,annotation,I am not sure what he's trying to say here... Is the pre-recorded online lecture only 20 minutes long?
32,Valentina Bau,annotation,This is definitely one of the positive sides of online lectures.
33,Valentina Bau,annotation,"I think that this is a great model and I can see it working quite well in one of my courses.I do believe, though, that this type of ""interactive lecture"" can only work with a group of 100max students."
34,Valentina Bau,comment,"This is a very interesting approach and I'd be very open to experiment it in one of my courses. My question is: would this type of lecture replace the tutorials, which are part of the Australian university education system? (not sure about the US) Or are we looking at having an online lecture, a face-to-face flipped lecture, plus tutorials?? I am interested to understand where this is placed in our structure, or whether it suggests a new structure all together.I also would like to know more about strategies to implement this model with very large classes."
35,Stephen Doherty,annotation,"This scene demonstrates an issue I've come across in flupping lectures. The space for my lectures is difficult to use for group work for students as they are not able to move the seating. Traditional lecture theatres allow for discussion between, I think, 2-3 students who sit next to each other. Communicating with students in rows in front and behind can be difficult."
36,Stephen Doherty,annotation,We *hope* that students have already watched the video prior to class. He is making a great assumption here.
37,Stephen Doherty,annotation,Quiz on the content is a great idea.
38,Stephen Doherty,annotation,"In larger venues, a mic would be needed for the student to be heard."
39,Stephen Doherty,annotation,"At UNSW, do we need to obtain students' written permission to make recordings of them, as per this example?"
40,Stephen Doherty,comment,"I find this idea very exciting. I've tried it out a little in my lectures, but I find the limitations in the physical space to be a difficult hurdle to overcome. If the lecture is quite large, it may be difficult to get to all group and it would be a risk to have a small number of large groups. I'd also worry that students don't watch the videos before class, or watch them while doing something else. I know we could argue that they would do the same in the lecture, but I think it is more likely they will be paying attention in the lecture, than if they are watching it in their own time."
41,Samantha Furfari,annotation,"I do think that allowing students to move at their own pace through a flipped classroom style learning experience is a definite bonus. I do find that some students struggle to catch all the information in a lecture and this allows them to go and review material. On the other hand, I also find that some students require more examples which are asked in a typical lecture and you couldn't possibly predict to add into a pre-recorded lecture."
42,Samantha Furfari,annotation,I like this idea to nip any problem areas in the bud prior to moving onto other content. I also this is a good tool for reflection for the lecturer to assess whether or not the pre-recorded lecture is getting the salient information across
43,Samantha Furfari,comment,"I like the idea of flipped classrooms but smaller classes (&lt;100). I'm not sure how practical it would be for big course in first year (I'm thinking of CHEM1011 which has well over 500 students in it). I suppose I have always thought of lectures as the delivery of content and tutorials for indepth discussion and working through problems. The flipped classroom approach switches this up with lectures becoming more like 'old school' tutorials...would this mean that tutorials in the future become obsolete? I do see strengths and weakness in the flipped classroom approach, I think my personal preference would be for a blended learning approach. I really like the interaction with students during lectures as we go through content."
44,Anna Yeung,annotation,The videos would have to be structured effectively to keep students from losing concentration. I tend to jump around on the internet during long videos because of a short attention span and I can see this being the case with a lot of people.
45,Anna Yeung,annotation,I see the benefit in being able to review videos but I think I'd prefer to review concepts after their introduced by the lecturer.
46,Anna Yeung,annotation,"That's a lot of movement for a large class, I feel like more time is lost this way."
47,Anna Yeung,comment,"I'm not completely convinced about the benefits of a flipped classroom. Some elements, such as being able to re-watch concepts you might have missed in the first lecture are good but I feel it loses more time than it gains. The interactive portion of the lecture is essentially the same as a tutorial."
48,Juan Alvarez Gaitan,comment,"After watching this video and reading some material: tip 1: Don't use the word ""flipped"" with your students tip 2: Use innovative ways to  assess your learning outcomes"
49,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"Actually, a very interesting way of getting students more involved in their own learning."
50,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"I think this is a very interesting concept. Before attending to the class, students have already had to think about what is going to be talked about. In this way, curiosity can act as a principal motivation for getting engaged in your own learning."
51,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"The fact that during a 5-10 minutes critical discussion, the professor needs to go on talking to each group and see what are they concluding, probably makes difficult an accurate evaluation (for the professor). I am not sure whether this part of the flipping class would work for big groups..."
52,Claudio Cazorla Silva,comment,"From this video, I have got three different interesting concepts:-Flipping the class for getting the student engaged on its own learning experience-Students are to revise contents before coming to the class-Intensive work in groups and discussionsIn general, I find the ""flipping the class"" concept very interesting and I do really think that by taking the student out of the routine they can get further motivate. Also, the dynamic that the students must revise the contents before attending to the class I find that is great. However, I am a bit skeptical on that the ""intensive discussion"" approach will really serve for teaching to all class of groups and in all knowledge areas. First, because this demands a huge amount of work from the professor, I doubt it may be accurate in big groups. And second, I find that the ""discussion"" approach always assumes that the contents which are going to be reviewed are somehow already integrated in the student consciousness. However, in some cases, I completely disagree with such a principle. Think, for instance, of a first time ""Quantum Physics"" class. Quantum physics does not really work in the macroscopic work in which we life, hence what is a previous knowledge students may have on quantum physics? generally, this is going to be null. Is there any sense in making a discussion about something students totally ignore? I take the ""flipping class"" concept with me, but understanding that the way in which you really make this may be very different depending on the number of students you have and the topic you are teaching."
53,Li Fu,annotation,"""flipped classroom"" is a good and efficient way of learning and teaching, but is it restrained by content, students number, available technology?"
54,Nicholas Richardson,comment,I have a format for my masters coursework that suits this (lecture 1hr and seminar 2hrs each week) but my undergraduate lecture is with 330 students so will have to give it some thought. How then to tutorials fit in as  few people have asked?
55,Li Fu,comment,"I think flipped classroom is a good and interesting way for learning and teaching, especially fostering students participation. But I think this way is similar as tutorial. If all lectures can be delivered like this, perhaps there won't be tutorial? And this way might be difficult for large class, like over 200 students."
56,Yue Huang,comment,"I think the innovation of flipped classroom interesting. It is flexible learning process and encourages students participation. It is a fun learning. In medicine teaching, we have Scenario group discussion, similar to the second part of discussion. The first part of video lecturing is still in person."
57,Yue Huang,annotation,"Apart from lecturing, there are collaborative projects to add on. In the class, there would be around 100 students, and about 10 groups. It is said through group exercise, role, time keeper, group presenter are appointed. If each group have 7 minutes to present, there would be about 90-120 mins for one lecture. Not sure whether it is doable in terms of time allowance in our university."
58,Hossein Masoumi,comment,"It is a good model, however the main remaining issue is that how to encourage students allocate some times to watch the clip before coming to lecture. In many instances I realised that students prefer to watch the lecture after the class if they missed anything."
59,Pu Xiao,comment,"It may be a good approach for the students with high motivation to learn. However, for other students, they may need more the ""study atmosphere"" that a lot of classmates study together in the classroom."
60,Nicole Lasky,annotation,He said the lecture is cut down from 50 minutes to between 12 and 24 minutes for the online version.  Where do students make up the other content?  Reading the textbook?
61,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"I wonder how the open-note quiz in the beginning of class works. Is it formative or summative?  I attended a large first year class at the University of Arizona last year and students hand held clickers to answer quiz questions about the lecture during class, which counted as summative assessment."
62,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"I wonder how supportive UNSW is in providing equipment/resources, e.g. boards to write answers, tri-pods and held-held quiz devices."
63,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"I know that UNSW is supportive of flipped classes and that some courses have been designated as flipped.  I wonder if a class is designated as a three hour lecture and I am paid 3 x lecture rate if the university expects a 3 hour lecture, if a flipped approach needs to be approved, and if the pay scale changes."
64,Nicole Lasky,comment,"I am very interested in the flipped approach and I know that UNSW is generally supportive.  I have three questions - 1. Will the university provide equipment and materials. e.g. in the video the lecturer used white boards for each group and he used a tripod.  He probably used his own smart phone.  2.  If a casual is paid 3 x lecture rate, does a flipped approach need to be approved and does it affect pay? 3.  The instructor in this video said that his lectures went from 50 minutes to 12 - 24 minutes.  Where is the content difference made up?  textbook reading?  in class?"
65,Sanja Lujic,annotation,To engage student and stimulate critical thinking. Perhaps this translates to deeper learning in some??
66,Sanja Lujic,annotation,Does it always have to involve videos? Or can students be asked to read an article or lecture notes?
67,Sanja Lujic,annotation,1) Lectures are pre-recorded and only the key concepts are discussed. Time &lt;1/4 of traditional lecture. Is this enough? 2) Students can move at their own pace
68,Sanja Lujic,annotation,What happens if students do not watch the video prior to the lecture?
69,Sanja Lujic,comment,"Has merit but would be interested to read about evidence behind it. There are some key assumptions that need to be met in order for the face-to-face to work - students have watched the video/read required material, and group activities work as planned. I'm guessing this replaces traditional lecture/prac/tutorial scenario? I can see its advantage in stimulating critical thought and getting the students engaged, while simultaneously getting them to work collegially and developing their communication skills. Perhaps this approach can stimulate deep learning? I'd be interested in trying it out for some of my lectures."
70,Takuya Kojima,annotation,It is difficult to depend on students' responsibility on whether they prepare in advance?
71,Takuya Kojima,annotation,Is the video constantly updated? Is there any possibility to use the video recorded once again and again?
72,Takuya Kojima,annotation,What other students do whilst recording the video of student's talk?
73,Takuya Kojima,comment,"Prepare before the class and practice in the class is one of the main idea of the course I am involved in. However, the reality is that not all students are prepared when they come to the class. If some of them, or majority of them are not prepared, the activities we facilitate in a class do not function. Thus, we need to think about the balance between the preparation outside the class and in the class although I totally agree with the idea that classes are place where students put knowledge into a practice."
74,Alicia Bergonia,comment,It is important to come to class well prepared and be clear to your students to come prepared as well.  Brief outline of topics to be discussed is helpful
75,Alicia Bergonia,comment,I think flipped teaching is interesting and will capture the attention of the student.
76,Alicia Bergonia,comment,Flipped classroom may be very participatory in nature but would limit the amount of information that can be discussed in the lecture.  This is more appropriate in tutorials.
77,Alicia Bergonia,comment,Flipped classroom is revolutionary approach which can make good impression to technology savvy students. It can also cater to varied learning needs of students in big class/lecture environment.
78,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I like the concept of students being able to view and interact with the material at their own pace. I know that in my teaching it is often the case that managing the different pace of the students can have a great impact on class time and efficiency
79,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,One concern I have from some of my classes is that students do not actually prepare for the class and then you have some students who have to carry the workload. I can see that having a quick quiz makes students more likely to complete the activity but I wonder if there are any techniques people know of to make the students more engaged
80,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I like the idea of having the roles explicitly stated to the students for them to review themselves. I find that they are often a little lost in this process
81,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I really like the idea of going around and selecting the most interesting groups for recording and to present to the class. I can see that you would be able to get to everyone across the semester and this way there is less repetition when groups have the same ideas.
82,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I think that having the question in time within this setting is a very good idea. The only issue I can see again is that you often have unprepared students
83,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,"Forming students groups, working on collaborative projects"
84,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,comment,"I think that there are some very good ideas in this clip. I particularly like the idea of being able to assist the students to work at their own pace. I agree with many of the other comments that it is often the case that the majority of students come unprepared to class. While in a prefect world we could change this, I think that we do need to be realistic about the amount of work prior to class we expect students to perform. I think if it consists of watching the clip and making notes this is possible. In my experience with some flipped courses there tends to be an extremely large amount of outside work and the students are not motivated nor do they have the time to complete the material. If there are ways that we encourage them to complete and prepare for class while still having realistic expectations of them I think this would be a great model"
85,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,"Students complete open note quiz based on the lecture's content. Doing group's exercise: discuss questions, lecturer circulates during the class."
86,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"If the lecture is online, then what do we do in the lecture hall? In this video it became an extra large tutorial."
87,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"At UNSW, you need to get the student's permission to film them. I don't think this ""video the class"" approach is feasible."
88,Daniel Mansfield,comment,"I wonder how much time students spend being active in this model. Seems like there is a lot of overhead in waiting for others to be filmed, posing for photos, and handling oversized stationary."
89,Julie Thoms,annotation,
90,Julie Thoms,annotation,
91,Julie Thoms,annotation,I like that the student can watch and re-watch the lecture content to match their own comprehension rate.
92,Julie Thoms,annotation,This is a good idea - gives incentive to pre-watch the video material.
93,Julie Thoms,annotation,I like that the group work has some structure rather than just allowing students to self-organise.
94,Julie Thoms,annotation,The lecturer has the opportunity to interact with all the groups - this would probably encourage students to feel comfortable asking questions
95,Julie Thoms,annotation,"Great in theory, but this would be difficult for me now (and very difficult for my undergraduate self!)"
96,Julie Thoms,annotation,
97,Julie Thoms,comment,I like the flipped teaching approach. The pre-recorded lecture component would be very helpful to many students as they can spend as much or as little time as they need to take in the material. The upfront quiz during the group time encourages students to actually watch the video. I think that the heavy group work component might need some observation and tweaking to ensure that all students are participating in all roles.
98,Margarita Mandic,annotation,I think it is good to be able to pause the lecture and generally go at one's own pace. During in-class lecture it is easy to drift away and sometimes impossible to catch up.
99,Shev MacNamara,annotation,There is a lead time in creating the video content -- maybe have to prepare this a semester in advance?
100,Shev MacNamara,annotation,It seems like it would reduce the content that could be covered in the class
101,Margarita Mandic,annotation,It seems to me that the design of the room ( typical lecture hall seating rows) is not the best setting for collaborative group work. Tutorial style room with round tables would work better. In this case though the issues might be number of students.
102,Shev MacNamara,comment,It sounds a fantastic idea. I wonder what fraction of students would watch the videos before class.
103,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Another benefit of pre-recorded lecture is time saved for more discussions and Q&amp;As.
104,Margarita Mandic,comment,I support flipped classroom approach. I think if done correctly ( the right content is being flipped) it can be successful and make for an interactive class time.
105,Richard Mukurumbira,annotation,"There are some good ideas in the flip lecture as it enables students to prepare in advanceThe students must provide feedback meaning not only to they have to think through the context of the videos but also apply the concept  in own setting so that they apply the concept to their own lives.I am curious about the the concept in its application, but have reservations about the fact that preparation in advance is not necessarily the be end of teaching."
106,Richard Mukurumbira,comment,"Interest concept.  Flip classes does impose a learning expectation on students.  I like the fact that the student is more likely than not to actually think through in earnest the learning outcomes, activity and resources provided in order to account to the rest of the class."
107,Mel Chavez,annotation,Two efficiencies for lecturer
108,Mel Chavez,annotation,Students are able to publish their own critical and creative thought productsStudents are able to review the videos and improve their performance skillsStudents are able to develop more high quality relationships with their lecturer
109,Mel Chavez,annotation,Needed to employ a Flipped Classroom model to increase more active participation by encouraging more creative and critical thought and make the large class room experience more engaging.
110,Till Boecking,annotation,I hope this person slows down when teaching
111,Till Boecking,annotation,"It would be cahllenging to cover the same amount of material of a substantially shorter period of time. Maybe this goes back to the topic of last video: Choosing the right content and encouraging deep learning, i.e. even though there is less content the students may end up learning more becasue they do not just absorb facts but engage with the material and think it through."
112,Till Boecking,annotation,"I consider this to be an advantage. Thinking back to my own student days, I was often missing parts of the lecture while trying to take notes of what had just been conveyed previously. Having some time to hit the pause button to review the material in ones head before continuing is useful. Similar to the experience with this annotation tool."
113,Till Boecking,annotation,"There are two potential pitfalls with this:(1) Technology needs to work flawlessly, otherwise too much time is wasted on trying to troubleshoot.(2) Not everybody likes to be recorded. Maybe this has changed to some extent in the current social media landscape where people are open to sharing their thoughts and ideas but there are certainly people who would not be comfortable to participate in this type of activity."
114,Till Boecking,comment,"Pros: - Ability to review content (also given by recording ""traditional"" lectures).- Facilitate student engagement with the material (deep learning) rather than absorbing facts (surface learning)- Encourage lecture attendanceCons:- Discourages people who do not like to be recorded- Difficult to facilitate to keep students engaged with the content rather than chatting about other things- Challenging to convey the same amount of material with a reduced lecture time (video)- High demands on the time of the academic prior and post class to manage the activities and record content"
115,Corey Martin,annotation,The purpose of using the flipped method of teaching was to increase critical creative thought and to make large classes more engaging.
116,Corey Martin,annotation,Main lecture content is video'ed and 1) reduces content delivery time from 50mins to around 12-24mins2) Students can review material to suit their pace.
117,Corey Martin,annotation,I like the idea of planning in specific time for student questions as part of the lecture. However for a large class this may not be so efficient as there is still only 1 lecturer to answer the questions.
118,Corey Martin,comment,"The ""flipped classroom"" methodology seems to have merit in some courses and maybe not so much in others.There is an assumption that students have access to available infrastructure like ""internet"" to watch the videos and that they have done the pre-work.I note that the presenter says that this type of method is targeted at engaging larger classes, however the basic items like the actual lecture theatre (layout &amp; seating) is unlikely to be suited to the type of activities that he is proposing (e.g. group work) as my experience is that students find it very difficult to engage with others in teams greater than 2 students just to the physical constraints.There is also now pressure on the lecturer to both provide a professional looking video to students (as the one shown in this video was poor) as well as not to become lazy in recording the video once with outdated information, so additional time (as a lot of effort can be spent in what is known as post-production) to do this task needs to be considered as well as the skills needed to deliver this correctly.My last comment is around the emphasis that is put on the students learning from each other and the risk that they may tend to drift off topic as well as use their limited knowledge in an area to make conclusions and potentially treat their experiences as being the expert knowledge rather than researching others work in the area."
119,Rose Butler,annotation,"It also requires students take more responsibility for their learning, which is a plus, but for some this would take some time to learn and improve - depending on their high school educational experiences/histories. I do like though how it caters to people's different learning paces/strengths/weaknesses in terms of how quickly they take up concepts based on previous knowledge. It also means they could come to class with questions formulated rather than emailing after the lecture. We are teaching in 3 hour blocks with no tutorials, which is a great model and would adapt will with this."
120,Rose Butler,comment,This model would work well in our current social impact course which is a 3 hour seminar and based strongly around team work (as well as individual assessments outside the classroom).
121,Kyllie Cripps,annotation,What about those students who are put off by the video recording?
122,Kyllie Cripps,annotation,I wonder whether it increases/decreases student attendance providing the lecture beforehand?
123,Arash Khatamianfar,annotation,"In engineering, I have noticed that even with traditionally classroom-focused learning, students often tend to skip classes and just study lecture notes at home."
124,Arash Khatamianfar,annotation,"I agree with the fact that this method can save time for both students and lecturer, particularly the pace of getting and presenting the materials via video, but it may depend on course outline and whether the intention is to add more topics in one session or just to spend more time on practicing what is given in the video."
125,Jessica Bellamy,annotation,Whilst the flipped classroom design is great for your proactive and engaged students who will pre-read the lecture conent and engage is classroom activities - I believe the continually recording and posting on the web for everyone available - gives those students who don't engage 'an easy way out'
126,Arash Khatamianfar,comment,"I feel that there are great potentials in flipped classrooms, but I believe it should be tailored based on the discipline and the course so that it can be more productive and encouraging for students to engage in class activities. One example is that the basic background can be reviewed in the pre-recorded video and then in the class students could better follow new materials rather than losing focus due to lack of background knowledge, and also tutorial classes can also be combined in some form of flipped classroom."
127,Jessica Bellamy,comment,1. FC = works well for large engaged classes2. The 'ideal' students carry the 'survivors' through the course3. Builds rapport between teacher and student4. Can the material really be covered in 15-25mins?4. No opportunity for students to ask questions whilst going through the material? Might be more difficult to understand the concepts if you have to wait until the interactive classroom
128,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,watch video before class
129,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,Lectures are cut down
130,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,Group exercises
131,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,Presentations
132,Abrar Chughtai,comment,"This method is definitely useful but I think may not be applied in all situations. Would be very difficult to manage in cases of large classroom setting, like this. Moreover the teaching curriculum and nature subject also matters.For example this might not be helpful in case of bio statistics."
