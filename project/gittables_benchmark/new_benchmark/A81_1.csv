0,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,<p>Helpful introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining!</p>,,
1,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,"<p>Data has great power. It tells us how the world works in a most persuasive way. In a data-driven world, learning analytics becomes a cutting-edge research topic. With a huge impact on education, learning analytics needs our considerations. In this chapter, the author suggests that we need to think about the provocations in order to reflect on the epistemology-assessment-pedagogy (EPA) claims being made through the deployment of a learning analytic too within a given context.</p>",,

Is it ethical to use some sensitive features to make predictions of students?</p>",,

6,,,,Blog,"<p>The website page introduces Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup, a general framework of data visualization criticism. Three investigations are mentioned: What is the QUESTION? What does the DATA say? What does the VISUAL say? The checkup can be really useful, especially when we are organizing the thinking behind critique.</p>",,
7,,,en,,"<p>The paper introduces the implementation of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization. It identifies student dropout from K-12 longitudinal grades. It is an excellent example of how we can utilize educational data, providing an interesting path of data driven decision-making (3DM) in educational settings, which is a hot topic during recent years.</p>",,
8,,,en,,"<p>In education, we cares about the relationship between students and the influence it brings. Social network analysis (SNA) is a perfect tool to figure out this. And such analysis can be used not only for students but also for teachers, teacher educators, and school administrators. Such implementation would benefit the whole education cycle.</p>",,
9,,,,,"<p>This talk has updated my perspective of educational data. I agree with the professor that education should be customized. Students should not always be “compared to others.” Instead, they need to be treated as individuals. Educational data is a great solution to personalized learning.</p>",,

11,978-1-4503-1111-3,ACM,,,"<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of this semester, Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) have developed separately. There are <br />According to Siemens &amp; Baker, there are five key distinctions between EDM and LA:<br />Discovery: in EDM, researchers are interested in automated discovery, and leveraging human judgment is a tool for that; in LA it is quite the opposite, leveraging human judgement is the aim.<br />Reduction and holism: EDM reduces systems to components and explores them and their relationships, while LA wants to understand whole systems.<br />Origins: EDM is rooted in educational software and student modelling; in contrast, LA origins are related to the semantic web, “intelligent curriculum”, outcome prediction and systemic interventions.<br />Adaption and personalization: EDM performs automated adaptation, whereas LA informs and empowers instructors and students.<br />Techniques and methods: EDM employs more techniques and methods of classification, clustering, Bayesian modelling, relationship mining, discovery with models, and visualization; while LA focuses on social network analysis, sentiment analysis, influence analysis, discourse analysis, learner success prediction, concept analysis and sense-making models.<br />There is no right or wrong for both these two methods. We should use either of them according to the context.</p>",,
12,,O'Reily Media,,,"<p>In this report, Alice introduces the model evaluation basics to us. Topics in the report include machine-learning workflow, evaluation metrics, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and A/B testing. I believe by reading the book, one can get great help in his or her machine-learning journey.</p>",,
13,,,,,"<p>Interesting point, “Opt-out rights should be an opportunity for parents to decline uses of data that truly are secondary to the functioning of our educational system – not an opportunity to avoid resolution of education policy issues that affect all students”</p>",,
14,,,,,"<p>Measuring Learning can be difficult. From my point of view, there are three reasons: 1) Some results are not quantitive 2) Students have different backgrounds. Some of them make good scores but no progress; some of them make good progress but still bad scores. 3) It is hard for a single teacher to judge students by their performance. More teachers or more assessments might be a more compelling way, yet it is hard to realize.</p>",,

16,,ACM,,,<p>Interesting discussion about data wranglers!</p>,,
17,,,,,"<p>Interesting! I like how the author summarized the three dangers of personalized learning: 1. Education include general knowledge. We need generalists in our society 2. Students should learn how to learn in a way that’s not suited to them, which will be good for their life-long learning 3. The preference of children is not fixed. It might be sensitive and hard to make predictions</p>",,
18,,Youtube,,,<p> I find on google useful info about feature selection: <br />- Why don’t we give all the features to the ML algorithm and let it decide which feature is important? <br />1. Curse of dimensionality — Overfitting 2. Occam’s Razor 3. Garbage In Garbage out<br />- What are the most popular feature selection algorithms:<br />1. Pearson Correlation 2. Chi-Squared 3. Recursive Feature Elimination 4. Lasso: SelectFromModel 5. Tree-based: SelectFromModel</p>,,
19,,,,,"<p>Social network data use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets and observations they use. The data sets it develops usually look different from the conventional rectangular data array. In this passage, the author mainly introduces the nodes (actors) and edges (relations) of the social network.</p>",,

24,,,,,"<p>The paper introduces a teaching recommender system. I know recommender system has been used in many entertainment apps and shopping apps like Amazon and TikTok, but I never thought that it could also be used in educational settings. I would like to know more by reading more paper on this topic.</p>",,
25,978-3-642-39111-8 978-3-642-39112-5,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,en,,"<p>This book discusses topics on student models, skills assessment, alternating least squares matrix factorization, latent skills, cognitive modeling, and so on. People always find it difficult to discover the latent skills by asking questions. Big data provides a good solution to this. By combining experts and factorized mappings, we can make good predictions.</p>",,
26,,International Educational Data Mining Society,en,,"<p>It is always hard for one to decide which skills are the critical skills of an online course. To solve this problem, the authors use Q-matrix to develop a model to figure out. They also use the existing models (LFA) and human engineered skill models to evaluate their model. The results are very positive. Three aspects of advantages of the model are found: 1) performance 2) interpretability 3) speed</p>",,
27,978-90-77381-39-7,EUROSIS,eng,,"<p>Student performance can be predicted by data mining. Through analysis, it is shown that students’ achievement is influenced by past evaluations, number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption, and so on. It is really interesting and effective to use big data to predict student performance, yet I’m concerned about the data ethics issues behind this. Is it ethical to use features like parents’ job to make predictions of students?</p>",,
28,,,en,,"<p>When studying with educational technology such as online courses or robot tutors, students love cheating the system to get good scores. For example, they will continue asking for help, or they will input answers quickly and systematically. This paper develops a detector to find the differences between cheating children and the real-learning children using latent response models and behavior detection. It can be really useful especial when students are using the system without supervision.</p>",,

30,,Youtube,,,<p>Cross-validation is one of the techniques used to test the effectiveness of a machine learning model. It is also a resampling procedure used to evaluate a model if we have a limited data.</p>,,
31,,,,,"<p>This book is very useful and hands-on, even for beginners. It introduces the very basics in r. Learners will get knowledge and skills of how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools.</p>",,
32,,,,,"<p>This web page introduces Principal component analysis (PCA), a procedure that to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.The author gives nice visualisation of 2D &amp; 3D examples. The passage also use a “eating in the UK” example to illustrate how data that more than 3 dimensions work in PCA.</p>",,
