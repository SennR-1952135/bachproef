0,Excellent food and wine. Entertainment was good. Vendors were all friendly.,Lisa M.,1,0
1,The price we paid was an outstanding value. There were many excellent wineries present at the festival. All willing to present and explain their wines. Really good crowd of people to experience this event with. Free parking for the event. Highly recommended for any wine lovers or wine amateurs willing to taste the differences in the wine tasting experience.,Jonathan L.,0,0
2,"Had a fantastic time! So many wineries, distillery鈥檚 and cider vendors; not to mention local crafts, honey, maple syrup and cheese. Great value, libations and food. Can鈥檛 wait till next year.",Patricia G.,0,0
3,Excellent experience for the novice to a sommelier.  I brought a mixed group with me and everyone had different favorites.  Sellers were patient and knowledgeable.  Although it can get very crowded the atmosphere is festive and light.  There is a great selection.,Liz C.,1,0
4,"The variety of wines was wonderful from local wineries but to tout this as a ""Food & Wine Festival "" is very misleading. The ""food"" was cheese, dips, a other crudit茅s for sampling. At other food and wine festivals there was actual ""tastings"" by local chefs and/or restaurants. If you wanted something to eat you paid for something of a FOOD TRUCK",Marie S.,0,0
5,This was my third visit. I always have a good time.  The variety of vendors are great.  I've found a few of new my favorite things right here.,Louvenia S.,1,0
6,"The wine tasting wasn't bad. There was a good representation of NYS wineries and distilleries there and a good representation of food exhibitors with free samples. It was fairly easy access to the exhibitors and the tastings as it wasn't too crowded (went on Sunday per Groupon) and there weren't a lot of strollers. People are bringing there own wine caddies (ie, small pull along shopping carts) even though there is a very handy pickup service so you don't have to tote your wine purchases around. I had two main complaints. The wine offered for sale at the event was about 25% costlier than you would pay at a discount liquor store. The separate food vending area (not the food exhibitors) was extremely overpriced. I paid $6.00 for a small slice of pizza. Hot dogs sold for $4.00 apiece. I would expect a small premium on food but this was ridiculous. If I go again, I will bring my own food. Not sure if you can bring it in but one can always go to the car to eat.",Gary W.,1,0
7,The Wine Fest is awesome.  You get to taste hundreds of wines and food and buy at discounted prices.  Getting the Groupon price to get it is the way to go.  Definitely recommend it.,Kelly C.,0,0

15,"This is my third year in a row attending the Hudson Valley Food and Wine Fest but the first time I purchased a Groupon for it. It was really easy to redeem. Since the weather was on the cooler side and was also cloudy on Sunday, the 9th, there were hardly any lines and it was easy to move from one vendor to the next. I can鈥檛 wait to go again next year!",Kimberly G.,0,0

22,"Packed on Saturday,  much better on Sunday.  Searched both days for what could be even slightly considered 'gourmet food ' never did find it.  Some good wines, some horrible as would be expected.  For an event that could turn ugly really quickly,  this was very well done. Everyone (but one drunk person)  was nice and polite. I would definitely go again.",Laura M.,1,0
23,"long line when you first walked in. not prepared for amount of people,",Leslie C.,0,0
24,Great sampling of food and beverages. Will go back!,Donna K.,0,0
25,"The wine festival was wonderful. I just wish they allowed you to bring coolers in. I get that the food vendors want to make money, but some times people can not eat those options. We just went back out to the car and had a picnic but it would have been better to just have a picnic inside the festival. Otherwise it was one of the better ones we have been too.",Patricia Bolson R.,0,0

39,"This was my second annual 鈥済irls day鈥 at the Hudson Valley Wine and Food Festival.  I think my group would agree that it鈥檚 an great time, where one can experience wines from vineyards not always found in our area.   We all had a wonderful time, and had fun.  Most importantly, the staff was efficient and the set up was great.  All in all, highly recommended.",Maggie W.,1,0

42,"There was a large number and variety of wines and liquors available.  However the variety and number of food vendors was fairly small, particularly in proportion to the number of wineries/distilleries.",Rebecca C.,0,0
43,It was a nice weekend activity,Janelle C.,0,0
44,"We are so happy we went for both days. But next year we eill do only one which is very doable. The first day after 1pm it was very crowded but you could still get to the vendors but it took a bit so bring your patience! Everything was mixed together , wine, crafts, some food items which was nice. We had a great time trying wines that normally we would not have. There was a great selection from dry to semi dry to very sweet.  We came home with 21 bottles!  The second day was not as crowded,  some vendors had sold out of products we bought the day before but this is normal for a two day event. It advertised ""gourmet "" food but for us it was just food vendors nothing super special.  I woukd recommend this event ad someyhing fun to do.",Patricia M.,1,0

47,"The number and variety of vendors makes the event fun.  It is easy to navigate through the Dutchess County Fairground buildings and explore all the options.

48,"My 7th year, always awesome. Cant beat the price.",Vivian G.,0,0
49,"Lots of wineries, distilleries and food trucks along with small businesses set up with cheese, jerky, honey, maple products and more. Although it is set up well, it does get quite crowded and at time difficult to get samples and talk with those setup.",April D.,0,0
50,Nice venue but so so crowded. The one big issue is many of the vendors only had 2 staff. Once a purchase is made now there is only one person pouring. U wait 5 mins or so sometimes per table to taste. It was kind of frustrating. Glad to see there were more food trucks but I still had very limited options due to being Celiac.,Roxanne D.,1,0

53,We love this event. We have attended it for several years. My only wish is that they would space the venders out more so that it was not so crowded. Also invite some more venders from Long Island. They have representatives from Hudson valley and The Finger lakes,Kaitlyn S.,0,0

73,I am really disappointed that the entrance fee has gone up so much. The biggest disappointment was the restaurants charging full prices.  They use to give sample of food at cheaper prices Very disappointed.  The wine owners also should have given a discount on their wine they only gave a discount if u purchased a case.  Not going ever again,Naketa R.,1,0
74,"Space was nice, but spending money on a ticket just to spend money on food, wine, beer, etc is lame. I spent 15 bucks on a meal and 10 on a beer. Not really sure why they charge for tickets if everything cost this much. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend and would not go again.",Joshua B.,0,0

Carry your purchases or make trips to car to store purchases.

Only ""complaint"" is how crowded each table gets. People like to sit and chat with the server (sometimes there is only 1) and tables get backlogged 4-5 people deep. Aisles get crowded, and it becomes a bottleneck.

107,"I was very happy to have gotten the tickets from Groupon. This year the festival was not as well organized as far as walking through the buildings.

Just took too long at each place while winery reps were trying to do too many things at once.  Also, the amount of people cutting in front of others was mind boggling.  It was decent in variety & size but needs a tweaking.",Mary G.,1,0

246,It was not a real wine tasting as was suggested. The wine was given in teaspoons size and too many crowds,Chinyere O.,0,0
247,Wines were way too expensive. We had been going last  five years.  This year less wine merchants and higher prices. W won't be going back. But it is a lovely get away if you want to get out for the day and try some local vineyards.,Adrienne T.,0,0
248,"wine, food and drinks are overpriced. You would expect reasonable priced products if you are paying for admission fee",Fidencio C.,0,0
249,"very crowded, most times you couldn't get close enough to taste all the brands you wanted to.  Also, last year the beer tasting was in its own tent with many, many different types to choose from and we got our own beer glass.  This year I still paid extra to test the beers and it was in the food tent with as little as 5 or 6 beers to test.  Very disappointing.  I am very happy I took advantage of the savings at groupon for this, otherwise, I would have really been dissatisfied.  Also, the free Verizon bags were ripping and where people had placed their wine bottles that they purchased, fell out of the bags and were in danger of breaking on the pavement.  Thank you, Verizon for supplying the bags, but they should be ale to support a little more weight than the papers you stuffed in them.",Lucy E.,1,0
250,"The pick up area needs to be more organized.I waited over an hour for my purchases and they lost one of them. So with all the the years in the past pretty good memories, My favorite was at Craig Farm much enjoyable! Way To commercialized for me",Patricia C.,0,0
251,It seemed very unorganized. The wine pick up line was over an hour for us and it looked like after we picked ours up the line doubled. We were disappointed and will not return.,Kerri D.,1,0
252,"The wine offerings were extensive and I'm sure satisfied everyones tastes. However, the food venders did not seem much better than what you would find at a flea market.",Wanda L.,1,0
253,When I checked out the site prior to purchasing the groupon it was rather misleading. The food prices were way to expensive. You could buy the little food coupons for a dollar a piece at the venue. It was said on the site that most of the food was between $1.00 - $5.00 when in reality the average lunch items were priced at $11.00. With all the wine samples I felt it was very irresponsible that the food prices were so outrageous. I had to forgo a lot of the wine samples because I could not afford more food and I did not want to become overly intoxicated. Plus it really cut into the money I had allotted to buy bottles of wine from the vendors.,Tracie R.,0,0
254,I was hoping for local restaurants to showcase their craft but was disappointed that there were only a few venders selling dips and condiments. Also thought the demonstrates could have been on a higher level of culinary arts.,Vanessa S.,1,0
255,More wine! Their were less wineries this year,Jennifer G.,0,0
256,I think the Hudson valley wine and food fest is such a great idea however it is executed very poorly. I feel the fest should be more about educating people of the local wines and giving us an enjoyable experience instead it felt like a battle and competition as to who could drink the most wine. We also checked our wine and it took us over an hour to pick it up! we not only missed our bus back to the metro north station that come very infrequently. I don't think I will go back to the fest again.,Larissa F.,0,0
