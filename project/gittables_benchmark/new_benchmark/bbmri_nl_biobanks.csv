6,BioBank Maastricht UMC,"The BioBank Maastricht UMC + (BioBank) is specialized in storage of large collections of biological material for scientific research. Samples can be stored in our refrigerators, ultralow freezers and liquid nitrogen tanks. This gives the possibility for storage of biomaterial in a wide range of temperatures.


The BioBank is an initiative of the University Hospital Maastricht (azM) The BioBank works in close cooperation with Maastro Clinic (radiotherapy institute Limburg) and since 2007 a collaboration was started with the Parelsnoer institution.

In January 2005, the BioBank became a Central Research Facility (COV). Besides the storage of samples, the BioBank provides the service to carry out some standard procedures. The data of the BioBank is saved in a fully automatic web-based BioBank Information System (BIS), which was completely renewed in 2012. To ensure the safety of the biological collections, two emergency procedures are used: the Building Management System (in Dutch: GebouwBeheerSysteem G.B.S,) and the Temperature Registration System Xiltrix, IKS).).",NL
7,Academic Medical Center Biobank,"As core facility, AMC Biobank provides comprehensive storage services for biological materials and related clinical data. Materials can be tissues, cells, sera, plasma, liquor, urine, feces or molecular fractions, such as DNA and RNA. While most materials are derived from patients and belong to (biobank) studies, also materials for daily research can be stored.
AMC Biobank scheme
The Biobank is part of AMC’s division G (Laboratory Specialisms) and works closely together with the Durrer Center for Cardiovascular Research, hosted by the ICIN–Netherlands Heart institution. AMC Biobank and Durrer Center share people, rooms, protocols, and quality standards to facilitate high-quality sample/data collection and storage.
AMC Biobank currently houses more than 25 (biobank) studies, including various Parelsnoer collections, shared with other Dutch university medical centers, the HELIUS study on health differences among the residents of Amsterdam with different ethnic origin, and the MARS study on molecular diagnosis and risk stratification of sepsis.
AMC Biobank participates in (inter)national biobank initiatives, including Parelsnoer, CTMM-TraIT, and BBMRI.",NL
8,Durrer Center,"The Durrer Center for cardiovascular research (Durrer Center) is a national multidisciplinary collaboration of academic research institutes in the field of cardiology, genetics and biostatistics partaking in cardiovascular genetic and epidemiological studies and associated biobanks.
Durrer Center provides expertise, infrastructure and services for collecting, comparing, harmonizing and merging results from individual cardiovascular genetic studies. By combining these different cohorts and making them centrally accessible and visible it creates the possibility to deliver more effective health care strategies aimed at cardiovascular disease prevention, and at tailoring medicines and other treatment regimens to individuals, families and communities.
Since 2008, the Durrer Center has supported 32 independent research projects for samples and/or data storage. The Durrer Center has also provided research support for molecular biology and bio-informatic analyses.",NL

22,UMCG Research Data and Biobanking Team,"The UMCG has a leading position in biobank research. There is a long tradition in both research with long-term cohorts of specific patient groups and in population-based studies. Well-known Groningen Biobank/cohort studies are LifeLines, Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen, PREVEND, GIANTT and TRAILS. Clinical biobanks have been given a boost by the participation of the UMCG in the Parelsnoer institution (PSI) of the NFU.

Besides the different biobanks with large numbers of stored biomaterials and data, also a lot of expertise and experience  is available in the UMCG on all methodological aspects of biobank research (e.g. research design, bioinformatics, bio-imaging, laboratory processes, statistics, on legal and regulatory affairs and on quality and privacy). In addition, the UMCG invested in facilities for biobank research, especially large-scale ICT facilities and long-term storage of biomaterials. In November 2012, the Board established the UMCG Biobank Regulations, that provide rules and guidelines for the collection, storage and use of human tissue and associated data from patients in the UMCG.

UMCG researchers are active on important positions in all national research data / biobank organisations, such as the nationwide Parelsnoer institution (PSI),  BBMRI-NL, NFU research IT ""data4lifesciences"" , ZonMw data management projects, Dutch Tech Centre for Life Sciences (DTL), Surf Sara projects. Also in Europe, various UMCG researchers have influential positions in the field of biobank research as in the large FP7 biobank projects: BioSHaRE, coordinated by the UMCG and  BBMRI LPC , with the UMCG as national representative. In addition, the UMCG  is closely involved in Elixir, the European bioinformatics consortium.",NL
