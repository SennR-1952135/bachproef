18,Japanese,detail,마루트,りんごナス♪<br>お留守番は平気だった？
19,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,いつもと一緒だったよ。<br>ミカエル様に貰った図鑑を読んでた！
20,Japanese,detail,하루트,空の世界の生物図鑑だよね。<br>今日もずっとうちにいたのかい？
21,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,ま～ねィ。<br>お留守番はおうちを守る仕事だもん。
22,Japanese,detail,하루트,いつもありがとう。<br>お陰で安心して配達できるよ。
23,Japanese,detail,하루트,でもたまには散歩とかどうかなぁ？<br>初夏の森の空気は本当に格別でね。
24,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,散歩ぉ……？
25,Japanese,detail,하루트,ちょっと歩いた所に畑も作ったんだ。<br>規模は小さいけど里長に教わってさ。
26,Japanese,detail,하루트,アズも一緒に耕さないか？<br>いい運動になると思うんだけど……
27,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,…………
28,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,そこにナスはありますか？
29,Japanese,detail,하루트,ナス……？<br>ナスは春に種を蒔かないと……<br>夏野菜は来年かなぁ。
30,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,ナスはないのでなすね？
31,Japanese,detail,하루트,ないでなすね……
32,Japanese,detail,아즈라엘,そっかぁ。<br>ならアズ来年がんばる。<br>ちょっと台所に行って来るねえ。
33,Japanese,detail,하루트,う～ん……<br>やっぱりまだ気が進まないか……
34,Japanese,detail,마루트,今の自分は人間を怖がらせる──<br>前にポツリと言ってたものね。
35,Japanese,detail,마루트,私達星晶獣にとっては、<br>姿形はあまり重要ではないんだけど。
36,Japanese,detail,하루트,ここの人間達は平気さ。<br>とても親切で星晶獣にも理解がある。
37,Japanese,detail,하루트,アズの事情も伝えてあるんだ。<br>きっといい方向に進む筈だよ。
38,Japanese,detail,마루트,そうね。<br>ただ今は焦らず機会を待ちましょ。<br>引きこもり気味なのは心配だけど……
39,Japanese,detail,마루트,身体の再生は進んでるんだもの。<br>毎日ちょっとずつだけど確実に。<br>カリオストロさんも言ってたでしょ？
40,Japanese,detail,이스라필,自然治癒力が働いてる間は、<br>人為的な治療を施すのは逆効果──
41,Japanese,detail,이스라필,再生範囲がどこまで及ぶのか、<br>慎重に経過観察するのが最善だろう──
42,Japanese,detail,하루트,イス。<br>アズは寝ちゃったのかい？
43,Japanese,detail,이스라필,お漬物を揉んでる最中にね。<br>ふたりとも色々心配させてごめん。
44,Japanese,detail,마루트,謝るのは禁止♪<br>私達は四人一組で生きると決めた筈よ？
45,Japanese,detail,이스라필,ありがと。<br>でもさっきこの暑中見舞を見てさ。
46,Japanese,detail,이스라필,ルリア達の夏のバカンスのおさそい。<br>サンダルフォンも同行するみたいね。

62,Japanese,detail,사리엘,ピーナツ……
63,Japanese,detail,？？？,あ？
64,Japanese,detail,사리엘,店長……<br>ピーナツ剥き終わったよ。
65,Japanese,detail,마스터,お、ご苦労さん。<br>そこの棚に置いといて貰えるか。
66,Japanese,detail,사리엘,うん……<br>次のピーナツの箱は何処？
67,Japanese,detail,마스터,その前に休憩だ。<br>ずっと剥いてて指がバカになったろ？
68,Japanese,detail,사리엘,でも借金……<br>急いで返さないと……
69,Japanese,detail,마스터,真面目だねえ。<br>まぁ無理せず適当に頼むよ。
70,Japanese,detail,사리엘,適当……？<br>やってみる。
71,Japanese,detail,마스터,で……<br>ようするにナンパ失敗って話かい？
72,Japanese,detail,？？？,どこがナンパだ。<br>俺は普通にレストランを……<br>というかあのノッポはなんなんだよ？
73,Japanese,detail,마스터,さぁねえ。<br>無一文で旅客艇に乗り込んで、<br>この島に来ちまったんだとさ。
74,Japanese,detail,마스터,なんでも蟻を追ってたら、<br>いつの間にか乗ってたとかなんとか……
75,Japanese,detail,？？？,蟻ィ……？
76,Japanese,detail,마스터,変わってるだろ？<br>まぁ悪気がないのは一目でわかる。
77,Japanese,detail,마스터,そこで商工会が憲兵に取り計らい、<br>働いて運賃を返す話になったのさ。
78,Japanese,detail,？？？,商工会ね……<br>面倒を引き取って憲兵に恩を売るが、<br>工面させるのは立場の弱い会員かよ。
79,Japanese,detail,？？？,気に食わないぜ……
80,Japanese,detail,마스터,おい？<br>アイツ酒瓶を丸ごと……
81,Japanese,detail,마스터,サリエル君に絡むなよ！
82,Japanese,detail,사리엘,借金……<br>ピーナツ何個で返せるんだろう……
83,Japanese,detail,사리엘,がんばろう……<br>僕は<span class='scene-font-spword'>『虹』</span>を探さないと……
84,Japanese,detail,？？？,よぉ！<br>ノッポのサリィちゃん。<br>ちょっと酌を頼めるかい？

105,English,synopsis,,"Early in the summer, [플레이어] and the crew invite Halluel, Malluel, Azrael, and Israfel on vacation. At the same time, Sariel is laboring in a basement bar to repay his debts. Meanwhile, an ominous specter lurks just off the coast."
106,English,detail,,The first shoots of pale greenery have matured into a verdant canopy. A summery breeze rustles through.
107,English,detail,,"High above the forest floor of this island, a group of women have built a tree house, which serves as their home."
108,English,detail,,They are archangels—primal beasts created approximately two millennia ago.
109,English,detail,Halluel,I'm back! Was that the last of today's deliveries?
110,English,detail,Malluel,Sure was! What awesome work—if you were any quicker you'd be a blur.
111,English,detail,Halluel,"We had the right idea, changing the pickup route. Of course now we've got more heavy packages coming our way than ever."
112,English,detail,Malluel,That's proof of a job well done. It means people trust us enough to give us precious parcels!
113,English,detail,Halluel,"Oh, huh. That's like a dream come true for any delivery person, isn't it?"
114,English,detail,Halluel,"To be honest... even just a few months ago, I never would've imagined we'd be so good at this."
115,English,detail,Malluel,I know... I guess that conflict really changed us.
116,English,detail,Malluel,"Anyway, let's head home! We have to sort tomorrow's deliveries. Everyone's waiting on APS—the Archangel Parcel Service."
117,English,detail,,"The conflict in question arose when the archangels' counterparts, the fallen angels, plotted to end the world."
118,English,detail,,"After the threat passed, archangels abandoned the roles given to them by the Astrals in order to simply live their lives."
119,English,detail,,Their experience as messengers has led them to establish a delivery service for mortals.
120,English,detail,,"The archangels' wings make it easy to fly from island to island, and as a result APS is as popular as it is convenient."
121,English,detail,Halluel,We're home!
122,English,detail,Azrael,"Hal and Mal! Come in, come in, eggplant for the win!"
123,English,detail,Malluel,Was everything okay while we were gone?
124,English,detail,Azrael,Same as always. I've been reading through the field guide that Michael gave me!
125,English,detail,Halluel,"Oh, the one about creatures from the Sky Realm. I guess you've been home the whole time then?"
126,English,detail,Azrael,"Eh, well... You can't house-sit without sitting around the house."
127,English,detail,Halluel,Thanks for everything. We wouldn't be able to concentrate on our deliveries without you.
128,English,detail,Halluel,But a walk now and then could do you good too. There's something really special about the woods in early summer.
129,English,detail,Azrael,A... walk?
130,English,detail,Halluel,I'm putting together a little vegetable garden just a short walk from here. The village elder's been teaching me how.
131,English,detail,Halluel,Az... You should check it out. It'll be good exercise...
132,English,detail,Azrael,...
133,English,detail,Azrael,Do you have eggplants there?
134,English,detail,Halluel,Eggplants? The seeds have to be sown in the spring. Maybe next year.
135,English,detail,Azrael,So there's not an eggplant to be seen?
136,English,detail,Halluel,Not a one.
137,English,detail,Azrael,Oh. Maybe I'll visit next year then. I'll be in the kitchen.
138,English,detail,Halluel,Mm... I guess she's not really feeling it.
139,English,detail,Malluel,Earlier she admitted she was worried about spooking mortals.
140,English,detail,Malluel,They seem to really care about material forms.
141,English,detail,Halluel,"The ones here wouldn't bat an eye. They're really nice, and they understand primal beasts too."
142,English,detail,Halluel,I've told them all about Az's situation. I'm sure things would be fine.
143,English,detail,Malluel,Yeah. Right now the most important thing is just to wait patiently. I do worry about her being cooped up in here though...
144,English,detail,Malluel,"But she's getting better little by little, day by day. That's what Cagliostro said anyway."
145,English,detail,Israfel,Any artificial restoration could interfere with her natural healing process.
146,English,detail,Israfel,For now it's probably best to just observe as things take their course.
147,English,detail,Halluel,"Hi, Iss. Is Az asleep?"
148,English,detail,Israfel,She started snoozing while she was making pickles. Sorry for worrying you two so much.
149,English,detail,Malluel,Don't apologize for anything. We four are a team after all.
150,English,detail,Israfel,Thanks. I was just looking at this postcard...
151,English,detail,Israfel,It's an invitation to go on summer vacation with Lyria and everyone else. Sandalphon will be there too.
152,English,detail,Halluel,"Oh... You know everything, Iss."
153,English,detail,Israfel,Hahaha. Why don't you go? You two have earned a break. I'll stay here and Az-sit.
154,English,detail,Malluel,No way. I couldn't go without you guys.
155,English,detail,Malluel,We should all visit the ocean together. This isn't our last chance to go on vacation after all.
156,English,detail,Israfel,Sigh... You sure speak your mind nowadays. Both of you are a lot more outspoken.
157,English,detail,Israfel,Your call anyway. I'll keep thinking about how to draw Az out of her shell...
158,English,detail,???,Hellooo... Archangel Parcel Service?
159,English,detail,???,"I need you to deliver something for me... Well, actually there's a bit more to it than that..."
160,English,detail,,"Meanwhile, in a town fragrant with the fresh sea breeze, a scene is unfolding inside a backstreet bar."
161,English,detail,???,"Aw, to hell with it all!"
162,English,detail,???,"Women, I tell you... They wouldn't know a real man if one walked by playing a trumpet and banging a drum!"
163,English,detail,Barkeeper,What are you caterwauling about now? Someone broke your heart again?
164,English,detail,???,I was just trying to be nice! That's it! There was this tourist lost out on the street...
165,English,detail,???,"And we were having a nice little chat, so I recommended her a restaurant."
166,English,detail,???,It's not like I was asking her to go out on a date. But she gets this dead-serious look on her face...
167,English,detail,Sariel,Peanuts...
168,English,detail,???,Huh?
169,English,detail,Sariel,Barkeeper... I'm done shelling the peanuts.
170,English,detail,Barkeeper,"Ah, good work. Can you shelve 'em there?"
171,English,detail,Sariel,All right. Where's the next box?
172,English,detail,Barkeeper,"Take a little break for now. If you don't rest your hands after all that shelling, you'll make a mess of anything else you do."
173,English,detail,Sariel,My debt though... I have to repay it quickly...
174,English,detail,Barkeeper,"You've got a good head on your shoulders. Go ahead, but don't shell yourself out."
175,English,detail,Sariel,Shell myself out? I'll try not to.
176,English,detail,Barkeeper,"So where were we... You tried picking her up, and she told you to shove off?"
177,English,detail,???,"Like hell I did. All I wanted was for her to get a good meal, and... Hey, what's that gangly skeleton doing here anyway?"
178,English,detail,Barkeeper,"Who knows... A while back he came to this island on a passenger ship, not a rupie to his name."
179,English,detail,Barkeeper,"He said he was following a column of ants or something, and before he knew it he'd boarded."
180,English,detail,???,Ants?
181,English,detail,Barkeeper,"Funny story, isn't it? Well, anyone could tell by looking at him that he doesn't mean any harm."
182,English,detail,Barkeeper,So the guards and chamber of commerce arranged for him to work here to pay back his transportation fees.
183,English,detail,???,"The chamber of commerce, huh? Bet they took charge of his case so the guards would owe them one. Of course, they left the actual work to someone lower on the ladder..."
184,English,detail,???,That burns my bunions.
185,English,detail,Barkeeper,Huh? That guy just walked off with the whole bottle...
186,English,detail,Barkeeper,"Hey, don't cause Sarry any trouble!"
187,English,detail,Sariel,This debt... How many more peanuts till it's all paid back?
188,English,detail,Sariel,I have to stay strong... Until I can find that rainbow...
189,English,detail,???,"Hey, Sarry, you gangly skeleton... Here ya go. You're in charge of keeping my cup full."
190,English,detail,Sariel,...?
191,English,detail,,"Meanwhile off the coast on a small, luxurious vessel..."
192,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,Mmmh! Blue as far as the eye can see!
193,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,It's so gorgeous! This has to be the best vacation of my life.
194,English,detail,Young Man,Glad you're enjoying it. I couldn't imagine a better vacation either.
195,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,Really? But didn't you say you came last year?
196,English,detail,Young Man,Hahaha... A man all alone on a ship is no kinda vacation.
197,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,<span class='scene-font-italic'>Alone?</span> But I found a bottle of ladies' perfume in the cabin.
198,English,detail,Young Man,Uh-oh! Must've had a little too much to drink! I can barely walk...
199,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,"Oh, come on! Don't play dumb!"
200,English,detail,Young Man,"Hahaha! Come on, jump in!"
201,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,All right... But this is kind of scary. I've never swum this far from land.
202,English,detail,Young Man,You're fine. Just hold on to me and we'll swim together.
203,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,"Ah, wait up! Don't leave me alone!"
204,English,detail,Young Man,...
205,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,Hey! Answer me!
206,English,detail,Young Man,...
207,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,What... What is this...
208,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,It can't be...
209,English,detail,Beautiful Woman,Aaaaah!
