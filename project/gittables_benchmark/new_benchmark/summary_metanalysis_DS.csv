119,GSE79842lymphoblastoid,Homo sapiens,RNAseq from disomic and trisomic fibroblasts and lymphoblastoids,PC1 separates not perfectly genotypes
120,GSE84526,Mus musculus,RNA was sequenced from Normal and DP 16 mice,Data are not stranded as said in the protocol. PC1 separates genotypes
121,GSE84531monocytes,Homo sapiens,RNA was sequenced from Disomic and Trisomic individuals for chromosome 21,PC2 separates genotypes
122,GSE84531tcells,Homo sapiens,RNA was sequenced from Disomic and Trisomic individuals for chromosome 21,
123,GSE121066,Mus musculus,Whole bone marrow was harvested from 6-8-week-old mice and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were plated in B cell methylcelluose media containing interleukin-7. Colonies were collected by pooling the cultures after 7 days of growth.,PC1 separates genotypes
124,GSE128621,Homo sapiens,RNAseq transcriptome analysis of White Blood Cells (WBCs) from individuals with and without trisomy 21,"Sample separates on PC1 for batch (stranded vs nonstranded) and on PC2 for sex, and only secondly for genotype)"
