13,RDCBLR0015,"A preliminary risk assessment based on a Site walkover survey and a desk study have indicated that the environmental risks associated with the Site were low, and that a further intrusive site investigation was not required. This assessment is based on all materials currently stored on site being removed. The former stables are likely to contain droppings from pigeons and other vermin, which will present a health hazard to demolition workers, and must be removed in a controlled manner. Wooden doors and other items are probably coated with lead paint. Careful control of dust during demolition will be necessary. It is recommended that an asbestos survey of the buildings be conducted prior to demolition. On removal of the demolition rubble and existing floor slabs, it is recommended that the Site soils be inspected and photographed for signs of undetected on site contamination, particularly of oil spills..

Residential development should not be provided on the ground floor due to flood risk but general living accommodation could be acceptable, subject to the FRA. The site is next to an SSSI. Development should not adversely affect the dunes. Built development should be focused on the southern section of the site to avoid overlooking and a reduction in light for the adjacent residential development to the north and west. A new footway alongside the site’s southern boundary should be provided to link the new development to the existing Marchants Drive footway. The development should contribute towards the implementation of the Dungeness Complex Sustainable Access and Recreation Management Strategy (SARMS).

Appropriate fencing should be erected to maintain an effective barrier between the site and the adjacent Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay SSSI, SPA and Ramsar Site. Development should not adversely impact upon the neighbouring Rye Harbour SSSI. The site lies within Flood Zone 3a so any scheme will be subject to both the sequential and exception tests.

Furthermore, essential infrastructure should be designed and constructed to remain operational and safe in times of flood. Given the commercial history of the site there may be contamination in the ground. The water table is particularly shallow beneath the surface of the site (within 1-2 metres) and could be leeching of contaminants from other areas of the estate.

The Examiner found that the capacities of each site allocation in the Neighbourhood Plan were presently uncertain and that they will be a reflection of the size and mix of units within any planning application, having due regard to Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plan policies.

The EA advises a proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with the planning application that demonstrated any unacceptable risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process. The EA has also advised that how foul water is disposed to ground in the area is important due to the shallow groundwater and very limited attenuation that would occur in the unsaturated zone above the water table.
