0,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Feedback needs to be personalised, with constructive criticism provided to help students identify areas of improvement"
1,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Summative assessment more prevalent in large classes. When feedback is given, it is generally in a form of overall general feedback."
2,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Rubrics are useful as they provide information about what level a student has reached, and what more they could attain to maximise their grades"
3,Sanja Lujic,comment,"Students view of feedback seems uniform throughout courses - they all value constructive, individualised feedback to help them identify areas of improvement. Rubrics seem to be a useful tool in larger classes, perhaps coupled with general comments, as individualised feedback will be quite time consuming. Mixed reviews regarding peer feedback. All in all, feedback is quite welcome, and the more personalised the better."
4,Heath Pratt,annotation,"This is an interesting comment and articulates the value of effective feedback, "" it is more than just the mark..."". A mark without ""why"" is useless and especially when the student has performed badly. Without positive or negative reinforcement the student can  not develop the complex mental models required to adapt and apply the knowledge gained."
5,Heath Pratt,annotation,"It is interesting to reflect on the personal nature of feedback. It is very personal by nature, to be effective it must be, in that the student is revealing themselves and making themselves vulnerable in order for them to grow. Therefore, effective feedback must be constructive and meaningful."
6,Heath Pratt,annotation,Once again reinforcing the value of timely and constructive feedback from the student perspective.
7,Heath Pratt,annotation,"I think this is a very important point, there is no value in feedback unless the student can reapply the positive or negative reinforcement to reaffirm the now adapted/changed mental models."
8,Heath Pratt,annotation,The importance of establishing goal posts is very important from the students' perspective as it gives them something to aim for and correct if they don't achieve it the first time.
9,Valentina Bau,annotation,"I tend to use marking rubrics a lot. I indicate where the student's assignment falls in the scale for each criteria within the rubric, and then I give a final overall feedback where I might indicate more precisely the positive and negative aspects of the assignment.Yet, I find that some students are still not satisfied with that, especially where they were really convinced that they were going to get a much higher mark..."
10,Valentina Bau,annotation,"After marking a large amount of assignments, there are instances in which you can clearly see some recurring issues that most students have. In that case, I tend to prepare a few PP slides and go through them at the lecture or tutorial before the assignments are turned. This way, I address the main problems to the whole class, and after that each student gets his/her individual feedback. I find this a useful approach for me."
11,Valentina Bau,comment,The opinions collected in this video don't offer anything new to me other than what I had already learned through my experience:- give personalised feedback (no general)- use a marking rubric- be there to clarify your feedback to students if they don't understand it.
12,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,Including rubrics in your assignments can make the students feel less insecure. It is necessary to make clear what and how you are evaluating a particular set of contents so that the final mark will make full sense.
13,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"Feedback, it does not matter whether is done face to face or electronically, the important thing it has to be personalised."
14,Claudio Cazorla Silva,comment,"Feedback should be understood as a constructive way of commenting on students work. It is important to point out to students where their work look strong or where they need to apply some tweaking. Ideally, one should always provide feedback along with marks, even in the case the classroom group is large. Including rubrics in your assignments can make the students feel less insecure. It is necessary to make clear what and how you are evaluating a particular set of contents so that the final mark makes full sense. Another important point is that feedback, does not matter whether is done face to face or electronically, should be personalised in order for the students to take full advantage."
15,Sonia Graham,annotation,Getting individualised feedback when part of a large cohort is challenging. It may require students to seek it out.
16,Sonia Graham,annotation,"It's useful to get feedback in stages, building upon previous assessments and feedback."
17,Sonia Graham,annotation,Detailed rubrics with weighted marks for questions are useful.
18,Sonia Graham,annotation,Peer feedback in conjunction with teacher feedback is useful.
19,Sonia Graham,comment,"Feedback is most useful when it is personalised and specific. While general feedback might be unavoidable with large class sizes, students may feel that it doesn't apply to them.Peer feedback is also seen to be useful, especially when used in conjunction with feedback from the teacher. This was good to hear given that I'm in the process of using peer feedback to provide more comprehensive feedback to students doing group presentations. The background material for this module on feedback made me realise that I didn't explain my approach to feedback to students, which would have been useful. E.g. I could have explained that for each of them there is one comment on the front page of their assignments (in grademark) that gives an overall summary of my feedback on their assignment and that the rest are more specific details throughout. This might explain why some students were unaware how they went because they didn't realise that they had to look for the overall feedback on the first page."
20,Till Boecking,annotation,"Feedback is required both ways, i.e. from the teacher to the students and from the students to the teacher."
21,Till Boecking,comment,Students value meaningful feedback of their work to understand why a particular mark was awarded and how to improve their performance. This aspect ties in with rubrics that set out the criteria for marking. There should be recirpocal feedback between students and teachers and between peers.
22,Saud Albaqami,annotation,It is pretty much depending on the nature of the subjects as well as the size of the class. This influences the assessment types and the design which are in turn enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the feedback.
23,Saud Albaqami,comment,"It is pretty much depending on the nature of the subjects as well as the size of the class. This influences the assessment types and the design which are in turn enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the feedback. Having said that it is consisted of two stages, the first is prior the assessment, the second is after the submission of the tasks. In the first stage, it is the responsibility of the course lecture and coordinator to set up the assessment type that is based on the context of the subjects. It should be clearly identified in details it in the course syllabus It is the assessment type which the feedback is based on whether it is group presentation, assignments, etc&hellip;. . This should be very well explained to students prior the task to make them aware of the requirements. In the second stage, the feedback is should be given in personal way weather it is online or face to face in the consultation time provided by the lectures."
24,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,Who marks the assignments?
25,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,Effective and constructive feedback is given to first assignment. Students use their feedback to improve their second one
26,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,annotation,Rubrics are useful
27,Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe,comment,"Students value feedback in their learning. As a marker, to provide feedback and mark to assignments using a rubric is very helpful . When there is no marking guidelines given, feedback can still be provided, but giving mark is difficult. Is ranking useful or important ?"
28,Mariam Farida,annotation,"feedback is one of the things students tend to get anxious about and often students tell me how feedback affects them either positively or negatively throughout their learning process. i think marking rubrics are great ways to set up marking criteria but it should be tailored to every assignment specifically, where the student can know when to draw on theoretical approaches and when to use his/her own reflections..etc. also peer review assessments is great but i am not sure if it will be as beneficial to students as when they receive feedback from their teachers so that students will get some advises on how to improve, but i do agree its a great way to interact and less stressful for students. feedback is essential but it should not be perceived as the only tool to ""assess"" the student, and further activities and considerations should be put in place too."
29,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,For feedback to be effective it should provide suggestions for improvement. Just a statement on how good/bad the work is does not help students grow and develop their skills.
30,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,General feedback only provides limited suggestions. At least a line with personalised feedback to those who didn't performs similar to the group average would be beneficial.
31,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,"Using rubrics is beneficial not only as a marker, but it helps students give their work. They know what the lecturer is looking for. It is important to leave the criteria relatively general to avoid recipe-like assignments."
32,David Silvera Tawil,comment,"Two main conclusions come out of this video.  The use of a marking rubric and personalised constructive feedback gives students more opportunities of improvement. In the same way, feedback from students to lecturers can is important"
33,Omar Hussain,annotation,I manage a large class but I always give feedback + marks as just giving marks is not sufficient to let the student know where did he/she go wrong. I also use a marking rubric but that does not replace the feedback component.
34,Omar Hussain,annotation,personalized feedback is important.
35,Omar Hussain,annotation,I use that in my course. Assessment 2 is a short weighted one which has less mark and feedback is given to the students. They then take that into consideration when making the next essay (which is a continuation of the previous one) but of higher mark. By giving them feedback I expect the students to be more focused in this essay of theirs.
36,Omar Hussain,annotation,marking rubric + feedback to put into context what you as an assessor are thinking.
37,Omar Hussain,annotation,rubrics are important!
38,Omar Hussain,annotation,peer feedback is important. But should it carry weight?
39,Omar Hussain,annotation,personalized!
40,Omar Hussain,annotation,feedback is given.
41,Omar Hussain,comment,"Feedback is important as it is the avenue students get to know from the lecturer on how they have performed in the course. No matter how large the class is, feedback should be1. Personalized2. Consistent - marking rubric is important3. Constructive and should be continued i.e. assessment 2 should be built on assessment 1. If these things are not done properly, students will have no other way of knowing how well they are doing and what they need to do more to improve on."
42,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,constructive criticism
43,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Personalised feedbackProcess of following up on feedback is too hard
44,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Benefits of generalised feedback - useful sometimes
45,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,rubrics depend on course convenors
46,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Finds rubrics very useful - but don't always have one
47,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Positive structured peer feedback
48,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Should personalised - can be online or f2f
49,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Onus of acting on feedback is upto the student
50,Fiona Nicolson,comment,"The focus of the students is on personalised, constructive feedback. They clearly value the feedback whether it is provided online or f2f. It was interesting to hear how useful the rubrics are to students - however they are not used consistently throughout programs."
51,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Rubrics help student understand what they need to do
52,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,"Helpful because it comes from someone who understands you, but students would appreciate some feedback from the teacher"
53,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Feedback should be personalized
54,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Is the feedback onus on students? It should be on both
55,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Constructive criticism of the work.
56,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Personalized feedback is more educational. Access to marker should be easy.
57,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Step by step feedback
58,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,access to marker should be easy
59,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,"Two main conclusions come out of this video.  The use of a marking rubric and personalised constructive feedback gives students more opportunities of improvement. In the same way, feedback from students to lecturers can is important"
60,Ateeq Rauf,annotation,Standard rubrics help students understand to know what to do
61,Ateeq Rauf,comment,Students generally like to have feedback to understand what they have done and what they need to do to improve. Access to the marker should be easy. Also feedback should be personalized in addition to generalized. Rubrics can help ease the process for both teachers and students as can step by step assignment improvement. It doesn't really matter if the feedback is online or in writing. Onus of feedback in my opinion lies on both.

64,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,
65,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,
66,Abrar Chughtai,comment,Feedback should be constructive and personalize. Only marks are not important and need some descriptive feedback as well. Generally large group feedback not very helpful.
67,Anna Yeung,annotation,"Process of getting feedback can be difficult, especially in a larger class"
68,Anna Yeung,annotation,"I think this approach is great, it allows the students to actually incorporate the feedback (and requires them to look at it) into the second assignment and builds on the first."
69,Anna Yeung,annotation,Feedback goes both ways in the student-teacher relationship.
70,Anna Yeung,comment,"It seems like feedback is more effective when it is personalised, and the students are given an opportunity to use that feedback in future assessments."
71,Colin Clark,annotation,"I think it is important that feedback be positive as well as negative. At school I always saw it as criticism - ""feedback"" was red ink on my work, and at the time I felt that the less feedback the better I had done."
72,Colin Clark,annotation,"Feedback is always a problem - some students want plenty, many do not seem to read it."
73,Colin Clark,annotation,"Effective feedback is a tw-way street, with students incorporating it into the next piece of work (at least ideally)"
74,Colin Clark,annotation,"Well planned rubrics are very useful, but sometimes I wonder how validity is ensured."
75,Colin Clark,annotation,Personalization is important - but the hardest to provide.
76,Colin Clark,comment,"Feedback is important, and some students take notice - even if they don't, it should be available. It should be personalized, constructive and encouraging."
77,Julia Lappin,annotation,rubrics useful to students to help that understand what they need to do to improve their mark- will also be useful to assessors if there are multiple sites for assessment in order to increase fairness and standardisation of marking
78,Julia Lappin,comment,students value individualise feedback especially on early assignments to enable them to respond to specific issues with the aim of improving subsequent assignments.rubrics useful to students to help them to understand what they need to do to improve their mark- they will also be useful to assessors if there are multiple sites for assessment in order to increase fairness and standardisation of marking.
79,Yue Huang,annotation,"personalized feedback is difficult  in a large cohort, a general feedback is useful, but not enough. It is all about me, so a personlised me is more important."
80,Yue Huang,comment,"Personal feedback is more effective. However, it is difficult to do in a large cohort. From student perspective, constructive, suggestion, and personalised feedback would be useful. However, sometimes, the tutor would not remember every student's name in a group of 30+ after a few weeks tutorial. How to overcome this obstacle is not mentioned in the video and this will take a large amount of time and effort from lecturer perspective."
81,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Students value and appreciate a personalized feedback but realize that it it harder to achieve with a large class.
82,Margarita Mandic,annotation,Giving a feedback ensures students understand why they got a certain grade and shows what they could improve and work on.
83,Margarita Mandic,comment,Students appreciate and value teacher's feedback. Ideally they prefer a personalized comment to be able to identify issues and problems and improve. General comments are also welcomed. Students have mixed feelings about peer feedback. We have not had peer/self-assessment done in the course I tutor but I think it would be beneficial to try those assessment methods.
84,David Lyons,annotation,feedback = constructive criticism of student's work
85,David Lyons,annotation,"feedback, not just a mark"
86,David Lyons,annotation,rubrics help a lot
87,David Lyons,annotation,peer review is well received by those students interviewed about it
88,David Lyons,annotation,lecturers need feedback too!
89,David Lyons,annotation,use the consultation times that lecturers provide
90,David Lyons,comment,"All make sense - clear ideas that these students have. Relevant to large cohorts that I don't have, for the most part."
91,Amy Teale,annotation,A mark means more when accompanied by comments
92,Amy Teale,annotation,Not used consistently by Faculties/Schools
93,Nicholas Richardson,comment,"The more I teach the more I realise feedback needs to be built into the culture of a class. It is not just about informing a student or a cohort how they are tracking against expectations, it is as much about generating a dialogue which has all kinds of longer-term benefits in terms of student engagement and participation in class. It takes effort to listen carefully to every piece of group or individual work in class and then to give meaningful feedback on each particular piece but the effort involved in informal feedback pays off considerably - students become more comfortable engaging critically in class with the material. This boosts the learning (and teaching) experience for everyone."
94,Amy Teale,comment,"The video highlights how valuable feedback is to students, and how they prefer personalised feedback. They also like to have assessment rubrics available."
95,Li Fu,annotation,"feedback, constructive criticism"
96,Li Fu,comment,"Feedback with constructive criticism is important for assessment. It help to improve student's work and explain the marks they get. Certainly, I think the feedback should include both good sides that can encourage student, not just criticize."
97,Hossein Masoumi,comment,It shows different views on feedback from different disciplines which I believe increase the potential complexity on the process of providing feedback.
98,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Second assessment to give students the opportunity to improve and apply feedback. Awesome!
99,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Rubrics help students to plan/structure their assessments.
100,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Personalised feedback is better &ndash; not always given in classes with large cohort.
101,Jaz Lawes,comment,"Personalised and specific feedback is most useful for studetns. While general feedback might be unavoidable with large class sizes, students may feel that it doesn't apply to them so consultation times should be used appropriately but this can be exhausting. I really like the idea of a second assessment  to give students the opportunity to improve and apply feedback."
102,Natalie Ross,annotation,"This student really nails what good feedback is - constructive criticism, identifying what has been done well and what needs improvement. I am sure it is important to students to balance the positive and negative feedback"
103,Natalie Ross,annotation,"This staged approach, with a carefully planned escalation in the assessments to give the student the opportunity to respond to and learn from feedback is probably the ideal, but can only really work with personalised feedback."
104,Ria Arnold,annotation,marks without personalised feedback are not helpful
105,Ria Arnold,annotation,cant benefit from feedback after the fact...
106,Mel Chavez,annotation,Rubrics are very useful in knowing exactly what is required to maximise marks.
107,Ria Arnold,annotation,I find this interesting considering the feedback rates from students for teachers!
108,Mel Chavez,annotation,"It doesn't matter whether the feedback is online or face-to-face, but what matters most is the feedback should be personalised to the individual student's set of abilities and skills."
109,Claire Kain,annotation,This student's experience of a tiered assessment system that gets them to use feedback from a first assessment piece to guide a second one sounds helpful. It is also a real world application of feedback - something that might happen in a workplace or in higher academia.
110,Ria Arnold,comment,the overall theme was that feedback needs to be personalised. Another key point was that feedback is not very useful after the assessment/course.
111,Claire Kain,annotation,"Rubrics are very helpful - it is interesting to think about the different types, e.g. ones that give a rigid percentage for each point, versus more open guidelines."
112,Claire Kain,annotation,Interesting opinion about peer feedback. I have experienced the opposite with a class of students - several were very wary of peer feedback and were concerned that their grade might be 'brought down' by peer feedback and perceived their peers as underqualified to judge their project work.
113,Mel Chavez,comment,"Students appreciate personalised feedback regardless of the medium that it is given e.g. online, face-to-face. Rubrics when provided vary in amount of detail. However good rubrics are really valued by students to know exactly what is required of them so that they can maximise their marks."
114,Claire Kain,comment,"The value of personalised feedback is highlighted, which I usually try to provide in my teaching. I think it's an interesting idea to try and incorporate feedback at different times and in different ways - for example, something like the essay/feedback/essay assessment that one girl described."
115,Julie Thoms,annotation,Grades without personal feedback are not particularly useful
116,Julie Thoms,annotation,"Generalised feedback is OK if your weaknesses match the class average, but perhaps not so useful if you are having a rarer difficulty."
117,Julie Thoms,annotation,A detailed rubric makes the expectations clear for everyone
118,Julie Thoms,comment,"Feedback seems to be generally appreciated by this set of students, particularly when it is personalised (major theme across many comments). Other key points were the use of rubrics (to make sure the expectations are clear) and value of peer feedback (particularly when this is guided)."
119,Nicole Lasky,annotation,I find that interesting that with larger cohorts the students are given marks with no feedback.  I'm giving a lot of feedback.  I wonder what percentage of markers do.
120,Nicole Lasky,annotation,I like the idea of feedback that a student can use for the next assignment.  Students learn more and feel a sense of achievement.
121,Nicole Lasky,annotation,Peer feedback can be very useful if the students are given a rubric.  Otherwise it might be difficult for them to know by what criteria or standards they should be critiquing.
122,Nicole Lasky,annotation,Students really appreciate personalized feedback and it seems that they're not getting a lot of it.
123,Nicole Lasky,comment,"It seems that quality aside, students do not seem to get a lot of personalized feedback at all and they know it.  I'm surprised they don't complain more.  They've worked hard to get into UNSW and pay a lot of money.  I suppose the system of publication-based promotions is not geared towards it."
124,Takuya Kojima,comment,"Feedback needs to be personlised to maximise the benefit. Rubric can help students to understand how they should work on the assessment. However, the rubric could be too powerful driving force?"
125,Shanaka Herath,annotation,Peer feedback with a clearly articulated rubric will help to give detailed feedback in larger classes?
126,Shanaka Herath,annotation,"Rubrics seem to be very helpful for students, and I think it also makes grading easier for the lecturer."
