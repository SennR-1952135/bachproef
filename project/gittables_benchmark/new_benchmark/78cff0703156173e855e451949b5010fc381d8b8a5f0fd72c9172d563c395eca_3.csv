14,RDCBLR0015,"A preliminary risk assessment based on a Site walkover survey and a desk study have indicated that the environmental risks associated with the Site were low, and that a further intrusive site investigation was not required. This assessment is based on all materials currently stored on site being removed. The former stables are likely to contain droppings from pigeons and other vermin, which will present a health hazard to demolition workers, and must be removed in a controlled manner. Wooden doors and other items are probably coated with lead paint. Careful control of dust during demolition will be necessary. It is recommended that an asbestos survey of the buildings be conducted prior to demolition. On removal of the demolition rubble and existing floor slabs, it is recommended that the Site soils be inspected and photographed for signs of undetected on site contamination, particularly of oil spills..

Development should not destabilise the integrity of the dunes. Built development should be focused on the southern section of the site to avoid overlooking and rights to light issues for the existing adjacent buildings to the north and west in particular.

Given the commercial history of the site there may be contamination in the ground. The water table is particularly shallow beneath the surface of the site (within 1-2 metres) and could be leeching of contaminants from other areas of the estate. A proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with any planning application that demonstrated any risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process.

The EA advises a proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with the planning application that demonstrated any unacceptable risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process. The EA has also advised that how foul water is disposed to ground in the area is important due to the shallow groundwater and very limited attenuation that would occur in the unsaturated zone above the water table.
