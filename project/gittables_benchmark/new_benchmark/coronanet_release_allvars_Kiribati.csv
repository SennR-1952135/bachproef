26,"The Kiribati Police Service (KPS) advises the public that its core operations might experience a slight change in respond to the COVID-19 effects.  However, it will remain in service to ensure the public safety and enforcement of certain measures outlined in the Alert Levels.

Level 1 and 2
Attending public call/emergency
The public is encouraged to contact the police control at PHQ by phone (toll free 188) when non-urgent matter arises, the police control will then relay that message to the concerned police station. Alternatively, they can call the concerned police station for police service.
Otherwise (in urgent matters), the public is required to visit the police station for complaint lodging and other services they may require.
This is to minimize face to face contacts between the public and police officers.
When attending calls police officers must
employ social distancing (1.5-2m) from a person to be arrested by firstly asking him/her to turn around and to put his/her hands on his/her back
if the person didn’t comply with the above instruction, police officers may employ reasonable force to the person resisting arrest by using baton, or taser gun in order to minimize possible contacts
use disposable cuffs on the person and employ home detention in minor cases (at alert level 3, 4 & 5) only.
when transporting a person to the police station (in serious cases), police officers must ensure that the person transported should be cuffed first before placing a surgical mask on his/her face to prevent possible transmission of the virus en-route to the station
Interviewing people

In serious cases (crimes) where police-customer interview has to be conducted, a police officer (interviewer) must:

Comply with the basic prevention procedures in Level 3 especially wearing surgical masks, washing hands before and after dealing with a customer, and cleaning of all surfaces (tables, counter) with disinfectants or sanitizers before and after the interview is convened.
Ensure that the person to be interviewed should clean his/her hands properly at the designated spot outside of the police station and to be given a surgical mask upon arrival or before the interview commences.

- Have they or anyone in their household been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19
case in the last 14 days?
2) Actions to be taken by a police officer

under Public Health Act).
- If cooperative, supply the sick person with a surgical mask as soon as practicable
- Ensure that the person must be detained in isolation to other detainees
- Contact the Ministry of Health as soon as practicable for their necessary actions

where the need to enter such zone arises especially in cases such as transporting a patient
to or from a hospital for medical treatment/isolation, OR delivering vital goods (rice, flour,
etc) to the people in that zone.
2) Maritime police to stop small ferries to and from nearby islands
Police maritime officers must ensure that travel by sea to nearby islands (Abaiang, Marakei, Maiana,
North Tarawa) is stopped completely. To do this, they must;
- Utilize their speed boat and other boats hired for patrolling purposes
- When come across small ferries with the exception of fishing boats from nearby islands,
they must return them asap to their original location;
 by giving them a verbal warning first.
