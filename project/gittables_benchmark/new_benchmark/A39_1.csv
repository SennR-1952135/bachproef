Learning analytics, as I understand, utilizes advances in computational and professional tools to advance the goals of stakeholders, most frequently teachers. The thing is, teachers don't catch everything, and the implementation of LA promises to address that... assuming they have the technical know how to use LA to capture that knowledge. This article seems to get at the tension of assessment and accurate data capture.</p>",,
1,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,"<p>I'm not meaningfully convinced that an ethical framework will necessarily improve practices within learning analytics; such frameworks frequently work to ensure that the status quo is not disrupted for power holders. The impression I got of the Learning Analytics suggestions seemed to be ones that would absolve the data scientist/researcher/engineer of guilt rather than any real framework. Instead, I would rather view data science practices, and those specific to learning analytices, as arising from their inherently political nature. Our goals are political, and thus our methods should reflect that intentionality.</p>",,
2,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,"<p>Predictive modeling is perhaps the holy grail of learning analytics, but it subsumes so many systemic factors, with truly siloed data. I think that predictive modeling here is missing a sort of ""secret sauce"" for understanding the pressures that students and educators might be under when they're asked to share their data for analytics purposes. It can seem a bit robotic.</p>",,

5,,,,,<p>It's nice to read something that at least offers a cogent alternative to Tufte. It has been frustrating to conform to a system of remarkably limited values as it pertains to data representation.</p> <p> </p>,,

7,,,en,,"<p>This provided a really pragmatic example wherein cluster modeling supported instruction for a following school year. However, I always want to be conscientious of data selection and design when building a model that accords a label to a particular student.</p>",,
8,,,en,,<p>I really like SNA as a starting point for evaluating a population based on commonly held characteristics. I would like to learn more about the quantitative reasoning that underlies an SNA and apply it to digital learning models.</p>,,
9,,,,,"<p>MOOC's present us with a new avenue of data collection, but I appreciate his concession that user's have little access to, or knowledge of, the data that is collected on them whenever we utilize one of their services. It seems to me that provider's of online services, be they moocs or apps, lure users with the promises of convenience and ease of use. I'm personally surprised by his suggestion of third party protections of user data.</p>",,
10,,,en,,"<p>I couldn't access the article, but the abstract made it sound like probability tracing is likely a much better tree model than the CART algorithm we used last week. This is aligned with what we learned about ROC curves and understanding the point at which we start to lose predictive strength as a result of a high/low margin for prediction.</p>",,
11,978-1-4503-1111-3,ACM,,,"<p>I actually read this article in the buildup to making my decision to seek out a degree in learning analytics. While getting a concentrated dosage of what constitutes LaK has been deeply interesting, I am more deeply interested in having both a theoretical and technical know how necessary to be successful in the field. I would like to see how EDM is applied in the field, and if there are things I need to be doing in order to catch up to computer scientists that may not necessarily have the content background to root the work in the political mission of education.</p>",,
12,,O'Reily Media,,,"<p>I didn't do the reading: to do so required that I give up my e-mail and picture for a free account. If nothing else, this program has made me more paranoid about providing that information.</p>",,
13,,,,,"<p>I appreciate the idea that data is just a fundamental part of modern education, and that opt-out rights should really be focused on the frivolous data collection that frequently characterizes the industry.</p>",,

15,,,,,"<p>Yup. We follow trends dog-sightedly, destroy extsiting systems in the process, and are shocked when our disruptions generate negligible gains.</p> <p>Education isn't like tech, and the ""disrupt"" ""breaking things"" mantra that so many developers shout is not meaningful in any sense.</p>",,
16,,ACM,,,"<p>Key goal is the generation of ""actionable intelligence""</p> <p>First step is the generation of ""sense"" that allows non-specialists to access conclusions from learner data</p> <p>Academic staff may have an adversarial attitude towards academic metric use. Sustaining a community of practice is pivotal.</p> <p>Data wrangling is fundamental in this sense- thy both gather and make sense of the data before turning that analysis into actionable recommendations. Data wranglers must also work to create conditions where academics and instructors have the data literacy to service learning goals.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",,
17,,,,,"<p>Okayyy, I get the author's point, but a lot of those conversations won't take place without funding, and research into these technologies is crazy stupid expensive in terms of research length, financial expenses, and diversification.</p>",,
18,,Youtube,,,"<p>Feature selection is crazy important in this field. It is great for helping me keep the whole ""lets use as many variables"" approach to a bare minimum. It's a bit too easy to turn to that, without running into the whole curse of dimensionality.</p>",,
19,,,,,"<p>Every text I've read on LA and Data Science seems pretty grounded in explaining the dangers of LA, as well as its limitations. But this one at least formalizes the timeline of an LA product and ensure that designers at least can shape their development timeline in accordance with principles that arise from government policy and student/educator rights. It should be required reading.</p>",,

24,,,,,"<p>I couldn't access the full article, but the sense I got from the abstract made it seem that the online only students did not outperform their traditionally taught peers. That said, they were more statisfied with the flexibility afforded to them by having both online and face-to-face instruction.</p>",,

26,,International Educational Data Mining Society,en,,"<p>Looks like the main focus of this paper was the use of clustering models to generate ""skill trees"" for online courses based on words used and types of responses. They used a Q-Matrix generated from a response matrix to build their skill trees and applied a Bayesian trace indicator to test for its accuracy. Seemed pretty cool... if I knew half of what those things were.</p>",,

29,,,,,"<p>Clustering is a great tool for feature selection and structure discovery. I've used K-Modes frequently since we learned of them, and I was hoping to use them in a project at Sesame to characterize the quality of our games on the basis of game completion. I also like the idea of penalizing more clusters, just as you would penalize multiple statistical tests that find significance by doing post-hoc testing.</p>",,
30,,Youtube,,,"<p>What a appreciate here is that we are forced to reckon with the fact that both the test set and the training set represent the future. I think test set design in particular is frustrating, and it can feel irritating to have to redo training if someone finds your model to be unreliable. But in this work, cross validation is how you defend the quality of your research, and it certainly beats post hoc testing.</p>",,
31,,,,,<p>This is a note on a text I have already read.</p>,,
32,,,,,"<p>So a principle component is some combination of dimensions that captures the makeup of behavior within a model. So, theoretically, you could use PCA to identify groups of variables that account for variation meaningfully.</p>",,
