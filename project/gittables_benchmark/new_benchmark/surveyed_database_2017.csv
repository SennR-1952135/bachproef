0,Rhonda's hill,0.5 m of incision in scar; could have happened post-slide; small incised channel runs into crown; large cracks in soil; elevation 175 m,59.19
1,Rhonda's hill,dense grass; diagonal flat crown; slightly deeper in center,8.64
2,Rhonda's hill,two incut channels similar to 095 but less defined (cuts to weathered bedrock) depth 0.1,47.58
3,Rhonda's hill,dense grass; bedding plane visible within scar and Steep creeker than failure plane,5.75
4,Rhonda's hill,0.5 m sandstone boulders; toe is at edge of outcrop,4.71
5,Rhonda's hill,small incised channel in slide that likely happened post-failure; slide mostly in soil with small regions of exposed weathered bedrock,28.68
6,Rhonda's hill,narrow crown; lots of dead plant material in scar; many fist-sized sandstone clasts,9.68
7,Rhonda's hill,diagonal crown; two defined toes; incised channel 0.35 m deep; whole slide star-shaped,59.09
8,Rhonda's hill,horseshoe-shaped; unmoved material in center; possible rill development in scar post-failure; difficult to interpret sequence of events; angular rocks in soil matrix,110.65
9,Rhonda's hill,long aspect ratio; directly below 105,65.51
10,Rhonda's hill,directly above 104; below 106; runout could have contributed to scour in 104 scar,62.62
11,Rhonda's hill,right side runs into 102; small horseshoe-shaped (third or fourth see so far with two distinct branches),15.13
12,Rhonda's hill,possibly runs into tiny rill; but grass obscures topography,3.4
13,Rhonda's hill,less star thistle than other slides on hill; clearly defined scar and failure plane; 1.5 m pile of sediment accumulated at toe,18.7
14,Rhonda's hill,0.2 m incision within scar; soil crumbles easily; small clumps; long aspect ratio,12.43
15,Rhonda's hill,defined failure plane; flat; heart-shaped,22.89
16,Rhonda's hill,crumbly soil; heart-shaped,13.63
17,Rhonda's hill,sparse grass below scar; left edge and crown of scar not well-defined; possibly old landslide scar in runout,5.1
18,Rhonda's hill,partially attached material around edges,2.23
19,Rhonda's hill,elevation 262 m; 1.0 m rounded sandstone boulder exposed in scar; perpendicular to shadow bed; left side conposed of partically attched blocks,10.94
20,Rhonda's hill,outcrop at toe; slide exposed many flat rocks parallel to failure plane,2.79
21,Rhonda's hill,shadow bed outcrop at toe; asymmetrical; right side of failure plane flat; similar to serveral other slides in region,9.56
22,Rhonda's hill,lots of star thistle; shadow bedding at toe,23.41
23,Rhonda's hill,large blocks in deposit; uneven failure plane; three incised channels in scar,44.98
24,Rhonda's hill,lots of star thistle,27.78
25,Rhonda's hill,relatively thick soil with fist-sized sandstone clasts; 1 m crack perpendicular to center of crown; cracked soil,19.29
26,Rhonda's hill,heavily cracked soil; 1 m sandstone boulders in slump; material that traveled downslope deposited in relatively thin; wide; uniform; layer; scoured rill in center exposing shale pieces that likely happened post-slide,38.83
27,Rhonda's hill,region of deep incision in center exposing opposite-dipping sandstone and shale; dead tree lateral to center of crown appears to have limited extent of scar; center rill likely scoured by overland flow erosion; velocity rise primarily due to one boulder,12.81
28,Rhonda's hill,cracked soil nearby; failure plane along dip of bed near crown; many exposed thin tree roots,18.83
29,Rhonda's hill,break in slope at toe that may have caused deposition; likely less water during failure because material moved as a cohesive unit,21.37
30,Rhonda's hill,deep; definitely 0.3 m within wb zone because visible in soil profile exposed in crown; runout traveled up and through manzanita branches; large number of exposed tree roots,30.83
31,Rhonda's hill,many exposed tree roots; stepped failure surface along dip of different sandstone beds,16.54
32,Rhonda's hill,"dry soil; 3 cm tree root 9 m away from tree with 3 m crown; sediment displaced very little; clear example of ""mega-diffusion;"" hillslope has sparse grass cover and lots of dead grass",9.08
33,Rhonda's hill,heavily cracked soil around scar; irregularly shaped; may have been many small failures,31.98
34,Rhonda's hill,many manzanita nearby; 1.0 m sandstone boulders exposed in scar,10.88
