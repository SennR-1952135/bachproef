0,102 Bailey Street Clunes VIC 3370,"Become a custodian of Victorian Goldfields history with this once in a lifetime opportunity being the Clunes Post Office building (circa 1879)
Set across 1147sqm is this impressive property which would be one of the most prominent buildings of its era in the township of Clunes.
The Clunes Post and Telegraph Office was built in 1879 to a design by the Public Works Department. The principal building was constructed by Messrs Lewis and Roberts at a cost of £4099 and the kitchen outbuildings were constructed by Charles Morgan & Co for an additional £279. The building replaced an earlier and smaller post office built in 1861. That the current building is so much bigger and grander than its predecessor is indicative of the township's rapid expansion and peaking of population in the 1870s as a result of both the deep-lead mining and the coming of the railway in 1874.
The building is designed in an Italian Renaissance ""palazzo"" style, is of two storeys, and is constructed of rendered brick with a slate roof. The ground floor post and telegraph office is entered via a recessed arcaded loggia with the entrance to the post-master's residence on the first floor via a lobby to the side of the building.
The building is of significance as a well-executed and preserved example of public Renaissance Revival design, as an indication of the prosperity of the developed Clunes goldfields (the area of first gold strike in Victoria) and as a key element within the historic townscape of Clunes.'
The most recent use of the building has been for a residence and library which has been opened regularly to the public and is a popular attraction during the famed annual Booktown Festival in Clunes.
The building offers a variety of possibilities and uses with approx. 5 bedrooms, multiple living areas, country style kitchen, large library area, study space, huge hallways, an original timber staircase, impressive cornices and finishings and feature fireplaces.
The property lends itself to further improvement and could be ideal for a business, residence, bed and breakfast or to renovate/restore then on sell.
Situated just a short stroll from shops, cafes, churches, school, only 30 mins to Ballarat and 1 hour 40 mins to Melbourne.
Opportunities such as this are rare and this property is sure to attract national attention so be sure to book your inspection ASAP.
