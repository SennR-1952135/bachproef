13,"New information and communication technologies are transforming the most remote and disenfranchised communities in the world’s poorest countries. This course examines the use of new communication technologies in developing countries. How do these tools enable ordinary people in developing countries to give voice to their own stories? Can new media equalize participation and access to information for people heretofore bypassed by the benefits of globalization? Mobile phones, Internet kiosks, and satellite uplinks are being adopted and adapted by resourceful and creative users throughout the developing world. Through analytic studies, samples of new media, and direct engagement with some of the users themselves, the class explores how this connectivity, both technological and human, is transforming life in developing countries. From eyewitness reporting in societies as closed as Myanmar to community action in countries undergoing political upheaval such as Kenya to public health activities in Indonesia to joint problem solving by farmers, scientists, and policymakers half a world apart, new channels of communication and cross-cultural awareness are opening up within and beyond borders.",,
14,"The course explores the dynamic relationship between global media and political thought and rights, whether through literature, film, music, social movements, and, more recently, social media. We will also explore the reception and recycling of such texts. Examples, and case studies, will come from a wide geographic area, especially in the Third World, including the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Some texts that will be discussed and debated ""Battle of Algiers,"" the global dimensions of #BlackLivesMatter, refugee rights, politics of self determination, among others.",,
15,"Due to the current rapid pace of change, social movements need to be ever more creative, responsive and innovative in order to be relevant and mobilize for change. This semester will focus on the Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice movement. In future semesters, this course may address different social movements. Students will learn the history of a movement, research current challenges and opportunities, hear from movement leaders and organizations, and spend time re-imagining and re-designing advocacy and organizing strategies, approaches, frames and campaigns. Working in teams, students will identify specific problems/challenges and then design and prototype innovative new approaches. While focusing on a specific movement, this course is also an opportunity to practice a methodology for innovating social change strategies.",,
16,"This course will look at various forms of workers' participation in politics, broadly defined, with a particular focus on social movements. Topics include macro-level political-economic arrangements that have shaped and been shaped by workers' movements; relationships among employers, workers, and the state; labor organizations and labor movements; social class and electoral politics; and workers' political subjectivities. Throughout, we will discuss the relationship of race and gender to work and class. Our primary focus will be the U.S. since the late 19th century, but we will draw on cases from a range of other countries as well.",,
17,"The 2016 U.S. Presidential election revealed the stubborn persistence of bigotry in the United States, and demonstrated that race continues to play a significant, if changing, role in how we define our communities, develop our public policy, and shape our democratic institutions. This course brings together scholars, experts, thought leaders and activists to examine such issues as racial stratification, implicit bias, and the complex, intersectional relationships between race, gender, and class. What is race and how do we understand it today? How are demographic shifts driving wedges between communities and/or fostering pluralism? How democratic is our pluralist society? What is the role of racial divides in fomenting political partisanship? What impact does racialized discourse have on such issues as the social safety net, immigration, criminal justice, technology, voting, and urban policy? “Race in the USA” is The New School’s second University course on post-election America, and is sponsored by the Provost’s Office and the 2017 Henry Cohen Lecture Series of The Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy.

18,"While the most successful companies tout the ""sharing economy"" as flexible, efficient and empowering, in fact, commodification, automation, and financialization are on the increase with drastic consequences in terms of inequality and exploitation. This course explores these increasingly prevalent features of global capitalism today to understand how so much wealth is generated at the top while the economic fortunes and futures of everyone else are rendered frustratingly precarious. Attempting to cut through the rhetoric, the course will investigate the ""sharing"" economy to understand how smart-phones and apps are enabling the commodification of private property and the untethering of workers from traditional forms of job security, made possible by Big Data and algorithmic management. We will explore how global supply-chains make the availability and movement of commodities greater than ever, significantly impacting the power of global labor for resistance. Through the housing crisis, the course shows how financialization, debt and the dispossession of wealth from non-white bodies condition the existence of a permanent underclass of cheap labor. Other case studies will include social media as a site of data accumulation, biotech's commodification of life, and social impact bonds that financialize the population's social welfare along racialized lines. We will conclude by examining the creative forms of resistance advanced by leading scholars, activists, and artists who are refusing the exhaustion and depression of these new economic realities.",,
19,"This course explores historical and contemporary experiences of African Americans, American Indians, European Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos in relation to the use of natural resources. We start with the contention that natural resource management is premised upon historically and culturally distinct relationships between humans and nature, and associated social and economic systems. These, in turn, are conditioned by struggles between individuals and groups over access to and control of land, water and other resources. We focus on political economy, property, ecology, identity, representation and narrative to investigate complex relationships between humans and nature, and how these have influenced urban and rural social life and landscapes. For instance, we examine how racial difference has shaped Indian rights to forest resources and management practices in northern California, Chinese American access to farmland in the California Delta, the environmental and social contexts of water management and drought in California, and divergent experiences of New Orleans residents before, during and after Hurricane Katrina.",,
20,"This course provides second year Gural Scholars with an examination of critical theory, social history and public policy dilemmas in an American context. Students strengthen their habit of critical and self-reflection on the questions that challenge society and deepen their knowledge of the multiple forms and interlocking nature of oppression. Through course readings, dialogue, guest speakers, excursions, and course assignments, students will further their understanding of creating and sustaining positive social change. Students will explore the interactions of social systems and American social justice history throughout the year, and will develop a final project for public presentation in the spring semester. NOTE: Restricted registration. Required for all Gural Scholars in the second year, all other students not allowed. This course requires both fall and spring registration.",,
21,"Museums are no longer content to be repositories of the past, elite centers, and exclusive spaces of privilege and authority. They have also become places where history, culture and the arts are used to promote activism, democratic participation, community engagement, civic discourse and social justice. How have museums, historic sites, arts and cultural centers addressed social issues and social change? How do these cultural spaces tackle economic, gender, racial and other social inequities, issues of oppression, civil and human rights violations? This class will examine how museums and cultural sites locally, nationally and internationally advocate, subvert, challenge and counter existing norms and unjust perceptions and policies through their exhibitions, public programming, educational vision and practices. Through several case studies, we will analyze a range of sites - from historic house museums to non-traditional art museums to national park sites to folk art museums to community history museums- which are employing innovative strategies of engagement and supporting community organizing efforts and social movement work. We will look at how museums approach issues of access, inclusion, diversity, equality and liberation. We will review groundbreaking social media and online digital campaigns. The course will investigate roles museums have played--and could play--in the fields of social justice. Students will be expected to make local site visits in their areas throughout the semester and engage in hands-on ethnographic projects

22,"In this course, we will explore two questions: (1) What is disability (2) How does (and how ought) disability inform philosophical theories of justice and social justice movements. In the first part of the course, we will examine different models of disability, from social models to medical models. In the second part of the course, we will explore the ways in which disability has informed philosophical theories of justice as well as how conceptions of disability have operated historically in social justice movements. Specifically, we will examine the role of disability in animal rights movements and movements for race and gender justice. Finally, we will examine the effects of systemic ableism, or discrimination in favor of able-bodied persons, within variety of spheres (e.g., language, feminism, bioethics, and public policy). Throughout the course, we will interrogate the relationship between disability, identity, justice, and well-being.",,

Justice 
In recent years, we have provided vital analysis to support effective public investment in mental health services for incarcerated teens, the launch of the Close to Home initiative, efforts to raise the age for prosecution as an adult, and broad public engagement on issues of incarceration and racial injustice. In the coming year, we will assess developments in policing, efforts to reform City jails, and a broad array of new programs for justice-involved youth and individuals with mental illnesses. 

Poverty 
The Center focuses on low wages, housing and homelessness, health and mental health concerns, and family violence. For decades, the Center has been a leading voice for improvements in the child welfare and Family Court systems. Building on research on brain development and toxic stress, our recent work addresses the needs of young children and includes an examination of new mental health programs for babies and toddlers, efforts to improve the quality of publicly subsidized child care, and services for young families in homeless shelters. 

Education
Our approach to education combines practical information for parents and cutting-edge policy research. Our Insideschools website provides definitive information to more than 1.8 million parents and educators each year. Recent research projects include a look at opportunities to support integrated schools in changing communities, an in-depth study of chronic absenteeism, a toolkit on implementing community schools, and several reports on gaps in math and science instruction. 

Immigrants & Global Cities 
Feet in 2 Worlds (Fi2W) works with immigrant journalists to produce news stories that express perspectives rarely featured in the mainstream press. Our reports highlight social issues, human interest stories, arts and culture, and politics. Fi2W has trained more than 100 immigrant and ethnic media journalists who work at media outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, public radio, and others. Current projects include examining climate change and immigrant communities, the role of Latino voters in the upcoming presidential election, and the role of food in culture and immigrant employment. 

Politics & Elections 
We have a long tradition of covering the day's most important political events at the city, state, and national level. This year, join our Politics and Policy Series, a thought-provoking and stimulating series of events featuring the hands-on experience and intellects of both American and global politics experts in order to dissect the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Check out previous events at The New School featuring Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley, top political strategists, and campaign organizers. "
