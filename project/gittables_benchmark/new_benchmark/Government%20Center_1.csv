This gated three story 1600 sq. ft townhouse was built as a carriage house and, during the Federalist era, became the workshop of famous Boston furniture makers John and Thomas Seymour. The original beams are still in place along with the winch and pulley that were used to transport hay to the upper floors (located in the fourth floor attic). You will find exposed brick throughout the house along with custom made wall panels made of Cypress imported from New Orleans.

It has been an inconvenience to 3 guests out of about 75, hence the mention.",Boston,MA,United States
