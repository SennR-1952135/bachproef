11,Awarded,"Managed Detection and Response Services minimise the time to detect cyber threats present in IT environments and reduces the impact of identified breaches through immediate action to contain and remediate adversarial activities. This is related to the establishment of a Lighthouse laboratory as part of the UK Government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In its response to COVID-19 and with only days available, MDC, on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care, is entering into contracts without competition or advertising the requirement. In accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and Procurement Policy Note 01/20, the following tests have been met:
•	There are genuine reasons for extreme urgency - the response to the COVID-19 consequences needs to be immediate because of public health risks.
•	The events that have led to the need for extreme urgency were unforeseen - the COVID-19 situation is so novel that the consequences are not something that MDC could have predicted.
•	It is impossible to comply with the usual timescales in the Public Contract Regulations (2015) - there is no time to run an accelerated procurement under the open or restricted procedures or competitive procedures with negotiation, nor does the MDC have access to an existing commercial agreement such as a framework or dynamic purchasing system.
The situation is not attributable to the MDC - MDC has not done anything to cause or contribute to the need for extreme urgency.",England

13,Awarded,"Ofgem currently stores system administration usernames and passwords in a shared software product where everyone in each team can see all usernames and passwords with system administration rights. There is no protection around these files, so each user with rights may change, or even delete system admin credentials. In addition, most of those usernames are generic ""Admin"" users and not assigned to individuals making auditing specific privileged user activity nearly difficult.
Lastly, we have limited sys admin resources to create new server services, administrate existing one and collapse services identified for decommissioning.
We are looking for a technical solution supported by PAM professional services  that helps resolve the risk associated with unmonitored, unlimited priviledged access to Ofgems infrastructure systems and gain control over the privileged accounts to the technical assets

32,Awarded,"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the Agency) wishes to consolidate its security testing requirement for the next 3 years. 

Our transformation programme will require ambitious timelines in our projects and programmes. The need to deliver security testing requirements flexibly and possibly at short notice will be key. For this reason, we are seeking a 'call off' type arrangement with a single specialist security testing provider so security testing requirements can be met flexibly, at possibly short notice so not delaying project timelines and to a consistent and high quality.
In addition to security testing associated with projects the Agency retains a requirement for annual IT Health Checks at its MHRA/CPRD centre and at NIBSC, not least to support its PSN and PND accreditations. However, given the nature of these tests then it is fully expected that a longer lead in period will need to be agreed with the chosen supplier.",London
