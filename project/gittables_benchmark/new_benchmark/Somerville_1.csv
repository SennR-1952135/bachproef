I do not have parking space available for this apartment. There is 2 hours parking restriction on the street (across the street and a little to the right as you face the house) Mon-Frid 8am-6pm. Practically you would be fine parking there anytime after 4pm, overnight, and until 10 am the next day, and all day/night on weekends. DO NOT park right in front of the house where Resident Parking is indicated. There is also parking lot (Maffa Way Parking) next to the T stop (Sullivan Station) 3 min walk from the house.
