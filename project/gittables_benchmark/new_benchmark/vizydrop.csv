",,Anna S-developer
33,User Log Page should be designed and created,,,Oleg Se-developer
34,Nested JSON clever parsing,"Scenarios
JSON Array with simple objects gives one data source
This one [ { a: 1}, { a: 2}, { a: 3} ]
gives us [ { a: 1}, { a: 2}, { a: 3} ]
JSON object with several keys gives several data sources
This one
{
b: [ { i: 1}, { i: 2}, { i: 3} ],
c: [ { r: 1}, { r: 2}, { r: 3} ]
}
gives us
[ { i: 1}, { i: 2}, { i: 3} ] with name ""b"" and [ { r: 1}, { r: 2}, { r: 3} ] with name ""c""
JSON Array object with objects which has nested arrays gives us several data sources
This one
[{
i: 1, a: [{n: 1}, {n: 5} ]
},
{
i: 2, a: [{n: 3}]
}]
gives us
[ { i: 1, ""a count"": 2, ""a sum n"": 6 }, { i: 2, ""a count"": 1, ""a sum n"": 3} with base name ""i""
and
[
{ 'a.n': 1, i: 1 },
{ 'a.n': 5, i: 1 },
{ 'a.n': 3, i: 2 }
]
with base name ""a""
