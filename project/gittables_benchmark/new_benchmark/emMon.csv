10,"In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, ""flux"" implies per unit area, called ""flux density"" in physics. The atmosphere convective mass flux is the vertical transport of mass for a field of cumulus clouds or thermals, given by the product of air density and vertical velocity. For an area-average, cell_methods should specify whether the average is over all the area or the area of updrafts only.",mcu,real
11,Calculated as the convective mass flux divided by the area of the whole grid cell (not just the area of the cloud).,mcd,real
12,"This includes sources and sinks from parametrized physics (e.g. radiation, convection, boundary layer, stratiform condensation/evaporation, etc.). It excludes sources and sinks from resolved dynamics and numerical diffusion not associated with parametrized physics.  For example, any vertical diffusion which is part of the boundary layer mixing scheme should be included, while numerical diffusion applied in addition to physics or resolved dynamics should be excluded.  This term is required to check the closure of the heat budget.",tntmp,
