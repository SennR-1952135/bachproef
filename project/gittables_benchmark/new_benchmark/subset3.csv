10,"In this course, students will have the opportunity to develop social entrepreneurial ventures to give low-income communities access to affordable, locally grown food. To successfully bring about the intended outcomes, solutions proposed by students need to be properly designed, scalable, and show the potential of being replicable. Based on insights taken from the positive and negative outcomes of Corbin Hill Road Farm (www.corbinhillfarm.com) and other initiatives to address the needs of low-income communities, this course challenges students to formulate social ventures that address one of the following aspects affecting access to affordable fresh produce in low-income communities: transportation costs, community organizing, scalability, creation of a cold chain, and access to financing.",,
11,"New information and communication technologies are transforming the most remote and disenfranchised communities in the world’s poorest countries. This course examines the use of new communication technologies in developing countries. How do these tools enable ordinary people in developing countries to give voice to their own stories? Can new media equalize participation and access to information for people heretofore bypassed by the benefits of globalization? Mobile phones, Internet kiosks, and satellite uplinks are being adopted and adapted by resourceful and creative users throughout the developing world. Through analytic studies, samples of new media, and direct engagement with some of the users themselves, the class explores how this connectivity, both technological and human, is transforming life in developing countries. From eyewitness reporting in societies as closed as Myanmar to community action in countries undergoing political upheaval such as Kenya to public health activities in Indonesia to joint problem solving by farmers, scientists, and policymakers half a world apart, new channels of communication and cross-cultural awareness are opening up within and beyond borders.",,
12,"This hands-on design studio is based on partnerships with external organizations and focuses on services that affect the well-being and quality of life of urbanites and urban communities. The real-life projects for which the students design may include youth services, food services, education services, and prevention and reintegration services for persons at risk of entering prison or coming out of prison. Students also explore new service opportunities through specific service-design methods and tools such as direct field research and co-design practices. This course is an excellent opportunity to build a portfolio and gain practical experience in the emerging field of service design.

13,"This interdisciplinary course offers students the opportunity to gain an understanding of key concepts and skills essential to become global consultants for small business enterprises focusing on women's empowerment and community development through design. The course will prepare students to support artisan or other community groups by developing sustainable business models through needs-based capacity building, product and project design and development, and by establishing networks of collaboration. In the summer, students may travel to Guatemala (or another project location) for the month of June/July to work directly with the groups of artisan women.

14,"This course focuses on the financial experiences of low-income people, especially women, in the US and internationally. The first segment of the course lays a foundation for why it is important to look at poverty, economic development, and financial literacy through a gendered lens. We will also familiarize ourselves with the asset building literature and discuss how this way of thinking about individuals' financial well-being constitutes a departure from traditional urban poverty frameworks, which tend to focus on income. We will spend some time understanding the extent to which traditional financial institutions (such as banks) and strategies serve (or do not serve) this group. We will look at relevant recent trends, such as the rise of fringe financial services that include check cashers and payday lenders. We will also examine alternative financial strategies, such as microenterprise development and individual development accounts (IDAs) that serve low-income people differently, and study best practices from the US and abroad. Throughout the course, we will discuss policy interventions that could create a better environment for asset building and ownership. The course requires no prerequisite knowledge of economics or finance.",,
15,"The course explores the dynamic relationship between global media and political thought and rights, whether through literature, film, music, social movements, and, more recently, social media. We will also explore the reception and recycling of such texts. Examples, and case studies, will come from a wide geographic area, especially in the Third World, including the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Some texts that will be discussed and debated ""Battle of Algiers,"" the global dimensions of #BlackLivesMatter, refugee rights, politics of self determination, among others.",,
16,"Due to the current rapid pace of change, social movements need to be ever more creative, responsive and innovative in order to be relevant and mobilize for change. This semester will focus on the Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice movement. In future semesters, this course may address different social movements. Students will learn the history of a movement, research current challenges and opportunities, hear from movement leaders and organizations, and spend time re-imagining and re-designing advocacy and organizing strategies, approaches, frames and campaigns. Working in teams, students will identify specific problems/challenges and then design and prototype innovative new approaches. While focusing on a specific movement, this course is also an opportunity to practice a methodology for innovating social change strategies.",,
17,"This reading intensive seminar introduces students to issues of urban sustainability across time, space, and scale. We examine efforts by planners, activists, policy makers, and citizens to improve the urban environment over time, as well as the role cities might play in the creation of a more sustainable planetary future. While we look to current practices in the field, we are especially concerned to untangle the multiple, often competing discursive, political, and governance systems that shape urban sustainability work. A central interest of the course is how notions of environmental sustainability relate to questions of social justice, the share of resources, and the distribution of wealth. Students engage readings and other materials from a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, humanities, arts and design. In the end, the course challenges students to reflect on how they might integrate the tools and concepts from this course into their own work.",,
18,"
This course challenges conventional notions of food in the city and examines the ways in which architects and urban designers can use it as a tool for sustainable urban development. Students learn about a wide range of urban food system innovations - from rooftop gardens and vertical farms to agriurban districts and continuous productive landscapes - and critically assess what works and why. By engaging in seminar discussions and field visits to pioneer food urbanism projects in New York City, throughout the semester, the class will explore the diverse roles that design professionals specifically can play in remaking the urban foodscape and the extent to which this can bring about more environmentally sound, equitable, and healthier cities. There will be guest lectures by sustainable food advocates from public, business, and not-for-profit organizations operating in the New York City metropolitan area.",,
19,"In this course, students will study the international human rights movement with an emphasis on the crucial role that media plays in representing and responding to critical human rights issues. In the last decade, the convergence of new media technologies with the human rights movement has had a profound impact. This transformation has enabled the globalization process of human rights activism through the rapid distribution of web-based news, research, and visual representation. Digitalization has also crossed over with traditional media (television, print, film, photography, and radio) enhancing both the production and the distribution of human rights reports. The emerging interactivity between producers and consumers of human rights information is also changing as people once considered as objects of human rights reports are becoming subjects who are now creating, manipulating, and challenging dominant paradigms of media representation. This growing diversity has had serious social and cultural implications on how human rights information is received, engaged, and transformed.",,

The Healthy Affordable Materials Project seeks to improve the lives and health of affordable housing residents by reducing the use of toxic materials in building products. Through the use of healthier building products and furnishings, the built environment contributes to the improved health of all people, especially lowest income communities.  

The HAMP collaborative goal is to increase the adoption of healthier building protocols and practices within the affordable housing sector, leading to measurable increase in building product specifications that reflect healthier choices. 

This change will result in reduced exposure throughout the system by decreasing or eliminating known harmful chemicals from building products and furnishings widely used in affordable housing.

Our Goals
In the broadest sense, our goals are for healthier spaces and healthier lives. To achieve this, we strive to:

1. Improve today’s commonly used materials to reduce exposure to toxics and improve health.
2. Foster knowledge and awareness of today’s healthier material alternatives—make them more marketable, accessible, and popular.
3. Invent, test, and implement tomorrow’s healthy materials.
4. Work with manufacturers to promote transparency and drive innovation.
5. Create healthier homes for people living in poverty."

New York City","Vision
DESIS Lab members explore the relationship between design and social change. Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.

Foundations
Three foundations guide our research in design strategies:

Bridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.
Valuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and “tacit knowledge”—information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.
Nurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies—the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.
Local and Global
The lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability. DESIS processes and initiatives involve the following:

Collecting social innovation practices and generating greater visibility for them
Promoting collaborative projects and organizing academic events to explore these practices
Developing teaching tools and co-producing courses internationally to showcase these practices and their contextual variations
Carrying out comparative research programs to track these practices and their outcomes  AMPLIFYING CREATIVE COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK CITY
Launched in 2009 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this initiative investigates ways design can be used to amplify community-led approaches to sustainable living in New York City.

79 Fifth Ave, 16th Floor, New York NY 10003","The Urban Sytems Lab is an interdisciplinary research, design and practice space at The New School focused on improving life in cities where most of us live. Our interdisciplinary scholarship examines the social, ecological, and technical-infrastructure system (SETs) interactions that drive persisent patterns and challenges in cities.  Our goal is that by studying and visualizing SETs dynamics we hope to provide new insight into opportunities for supporting wellbeing of human and non-human species for planning and designing more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Rapidly expanding urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change pose potentially dramatic implications for the wellbeing of urban residents and the natural systems they depend on. Our research, from theory to practice, aims to reveal and support the social-ecological-technical system processes that together drive everyday experiences in cities and urban areas. We use both empirical (e.g. “Big Data” analysis, field experiments, spatial methods, scenario modeling) and theoretical approaches (social-ecological systems and resilience theory) as well as cutting-edge data visualization to advance urban systems research and practice. 
Our research spans a variety of urban ecological research areas, including:
Urban resilience
Social-ecological-technical systems
Urban land use planning
Urban futures and scenarios
Urban biodiversity and ecosystem services
Urban ecosystem structure and functioning
Social equity and access to urban green space
Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change in cities"
