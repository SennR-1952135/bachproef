10,Tahong Tahong,Danajon,
11,Handumon MPA,Danajon,Visibility was terrible.
12,Looc,Cebu,
13,Looc,Cebu,GPS battery died part-way through (missed last 18 min)
14,Looc Tigib,Cebu,"Surveyed and collected until 11:27, then spent more time searching for PRBI (found no more). NOT a randomly selected site"
15,Bunga-billa,Cebu,"Searching for PRBI, MLP recorded ENQD and inhabiting spp"
16,Jean Pierre,Cebu,"Searching for PRBI, MLP recorded ENQD and inhabiting spp, but MLP forgot to mark which PRBI were found by GS and not on the transect"
17,Pasil,Cebu,"Santander survey (actually, 1km short). Forgot to turn on GPS, so drove boat back over track 16:30 to 16:45. Also marked waypoints at endpoints (�Santander2� and �Santander3�)"
18,Lang-tad MPA,Cebu,
19,Poblacion Argao MPA,Cebu,"GPS battery died at the end, so I added a waypoint named �Argao1� as we organized gear. We had likely floated a bit since the end of our suvey when I made the waypoint. I began recording habitat data every 10 min (% cover in a armspan circle)"
20,Tulic MPA,Cebu,Recorded habitat data every 10 min
21,Casay MPA,Cebu,"GPS appears not to have worked, so circled tacot with boat 15:31 to ? (before 15:35) with GPS#1"
22,Talaga,Cebu,
23,Bogo,Cebu,
24,Arbor MPA 1,Cebu,Began noting sygnathids for Kerrie. GS and MLP recording depth. GS depths are console depths (add 3 ft to what's on the datasheet)
25,Arbor MPA 2,Cebu,"Chosen because in sanctuary, but happens to overlap the survey site. GS depths are console depths (added 3 ft. to what's on the data sheet)"
26,Arbor Outside,Cebu,getting dark! GS depths are console depths (added 3 ft to what's on the data sheet)
27,North Granada MPA,Cebu,GS depths are now actual depths. We swam almost the entire sanctuary.
28,North Granada Outside,Cebu,Dive entered and ended on area of sand/seagrass and very sparse/poor coral. Started in front of a resort owned by an American.
29,Ely Point,Cebu,Dive ended when we began to overlap with Arbor MPA 1 survey
30,Macatol,Cebu,"Trashed reef, lots of Diadema urchins, many blast fishers here"
31,Goc-ong,Cebu,"Better coral than Macatol, but fewer anemonefish"
32,Demi,Cebu,Lots of plastic in the water. Many comb jellies. APCL very skittish.
33,Macatol 2,Cebu,"Still 0.8 km south of Survey Location, but further north puts us on sand flats or into Talisay. We are north of our Macatol survey site."
34,Katongan,Cebu,Ended in a thunderstorm and downpour!
35,Lobog,Cebu,Poor visibility! Lobog means �not clear�
36,Oca�a,Cebu,Difficult navigation: went in a circle at one point. Many seaweed farms. This is a proposed sanctuary.
37,Bonbon,Cebu,"Decent amount of live coral. GPS not on? Turned on when finished, ~14:50 (to get pointlat/long for transect)"
38,Abogon,Cebu,"Had to stop a bit north of actual survey site because it would have put us in Sibonga. MANY seaweed farms made navigation very difficult, particularly at beginning of transect when we were too deep to see the lines. MLP tangled often at beginning (distracted from survey)."
39,Lauis Bantayan 1,Cebu,Great site for PRBI
40,Lauis Bantayan 2,Cebu,Finished 20 APCL and 20 PRBI!
41,Pantok 1,Cebu,Lots of soft coral
42,Pantok 2,Cebu,
43,Sabang,Cebu,"Less soft coral than Pantok. Seeing ENQD, but all with APML and none with PRBI!"
44,Maslob,Cebu,"Better coral than other sites, including some branching coral"
45,Las Palmas,Cebu,Aborted because mostly sand
46,Saban 2,Cebu,Finished tanks from Las Palmas near area where we found 4 PRBI in Maslob
47,Tambak,Cebu,"Tiring: against the current. Getting dark. Lots of soft coral. No PRBI, few anemones"
48,Guadalupe MPA 1,Leyte,"Missed the main tacot? Very difficult conditions: strong current, big waves, poor viz. Found 3 anems with APCL and spent almost whole tank collecting"
49,Guadalupe MPA 2,Leyte,"Beautiful table corals, big parrotfish, sweetlips, surgeonfish. Corals are very shallow."
50,Sto. Rosario MPA 1,Leyte,"Near river outflow, very poor viz in places. Prevented us from circling the tacot and made following the reef very difficult. Low quality dive for searching for anemonefish. Spent most of the time trying to navigate. Reef we found was primarily deep (8-11 m)"
51,Sto. Rosario MPA 2,Leyte,"Patchy corals in sand, but primarily reef."
52,Badyan,Leyte,Reasonably continuous reef with coral cover as high as Sto. Rosario sites.
53,Ibarra,Leyte,Surge mixed mud into the water column: viz terrible. Hard to feel our way along. Probably no anemones or anemonefish here?
54,Tangkaan Beach 1,Leyte,"Very difficult to assign fish to anemones once we caught them, since so many of each and the fish wander many meters"
55,Tangkaan Beach 2,Leyte,"So many anemones and so many anemonefish! If we want to find PRBI, we'll have to stop taking notes and just search."
56,Son-ok MPA,Leyte,"MLP did some surveying, but in circles around GS as he collected."
57,Tangkaan MPA,Leyte,"Survey (by MLP) was not in a straight line, other than initial 27 minutes at 18-25m depth. GPS buoy left at a PRBI anemone while we changd tanks (3 times). Focused on collecting PRBI, of which there were many.  Large contrat (in PRBI numbers) from nearby Tangaan Beach. Coral cover, and branching coral cover, much higher here."
58,Tangkaan Beach 3,Leyte,Slow to survey. So many anemones and anemonefish!
59,Apid MPA,Leyte,
60,Didyo MPA 1,Leyte,"At very beginning, a section of good branching and columnar coral where PRBI found. Need to trim out beginning nonlinear portion if this is to be used as a linear fish survey."
61,Didyo MPA 2,Leyte,"Searching for PRBI in digitate branching and columnar corals (near where PRBI found on last dive). No swaths for fish/anemones. Lots of live coral, but evidence of destruction (overturned and broken coral heads)."
62,Conalum,Leyte,Few anemones or fish. Getting dark. Viz lower than Quatros Islas.
63,Cabatoan MPA,Leyte,"Coral heads on sand, 2m tall (dead). Coral quickly ended, leaving us on sand. Corals are shallow (1-4m) but offshore."
64,Palanas Outside,Leyte,All sand. Ended at the Prycegas boat terminal.
65,Palanas MPA,Leyte,"These are the best corals in Albuera. None north of us. Corals almost all dead with some very small encrusting, branching, and massive corals. Corals are shallow but offshore. Many HECR."
66,Magbangon,Leyte,"Corals only at beginning, then sand (with STHD and APPY). Missed corals from survey #64 ecause we were too close to shore (though the right depth). We overlapped the same section of shore towards the end."
67,Punta Lauis,Leyte,"Coral quite good (much better than Albuera). Dive from shore, so doubled back at deepter depth (ended linear fish survey before doubling back)"
68,Visca,Leyte,"With Dr. Humberto Montes, Kenneth, Art, Shem (three VSU Marine Biology students). Corals damaged by periodic storms (rocks overturn) then recover."
69,Tamakin Gamai MPA,Leyte,Tiny tacot!
70,Tamakin Dacot,Leyte,Lots of rubble
71,Candadum,Leyte,
72,Tabuk MPA 1,Leyte,Cookie from MENRO as dive guide
73,Tabuk MPA 2,Leyte,Mostly dead coral towards end of survey
74,Tabuk MPA 2,Leyte,Many massive corals. Good coral cover.
75,Liog-Liog,Leyte,"Massive coral. Few anemones, despite much live coral (massive). Rudy Baldoza and Cookie (MENRO) also dove."
76,Buenavista,Leyte,"Rudy Baldoza and Cookie (MENRO) also dove. Barren, dead coral, including areas of thick Diadema. Isabel smelting plant across the bay."
77,Kabgan,Leyte,Difficult navigation. Seemed to lose the main reef.
78,Macabog MPA,Leyte,Recovering corals after destructive fishing (trawling) was banned. Mostly dead. Corals are only shallow. Only a small area of corals.
79,Ipil MPA,Leyte,Bigger fish than Macabog. Only small area with corals.
80,Camp Downes MPA,Leyte,Coral area is very small. Not many more coral areas left in Ormoc. Most is sand and mud.
81,Lao River,Leyte,"Mud! Mangroves onshore, near river outlets. Near border of Ormoc. In river outflow: top 50cm is turbid freshwater, then clearer below."
82,Linaw,Leyte,Coral area very small. Almost zero alive. Anti-MPA group (�Indacpan�?) is active here. We've now seen all the coral areas in Ormoc... no PRBI.
83,Damolog,Cebu,"Lots of digitate branching corals. Bantay dagats brought us here for the corals, but our track appears to have passed the survey latitude (10.7635)"
84,Bawo,Cebu,"Lots of fine braching coral (thin). Realized I had lost the vial holder, so paused survey to look. Bantay dagats found it floating on the surface."
85,Tabonok,Cebu,"Large, well-developed reef, no sand. Lots of coral. Started near Alegre Resort (private MPA). Getting dark towards end! Ended because of the light."
86,Damolog 2,Cebu,Started in front of bantay dagat HQ. Very high live coral cover in the shallows (<2m)
87,Alang-alang MPA,Cebu,"Began at N side of MPA, swam S out of MPA. Big branching and tabular corals in MPA <3m, but no anemones. Swam deeper and found some anemones and fish at about 4m. Coral cover lower outside MPA. End 500m N or Daantabogon River. Shoreline is limestone cliff."
88,Moabug MPA and Outside,Cebu,"Shoreline is limestone cliff. Strange benthic cover of branching algae. Coral head scattered around, all small."
89,Maslog MPA,Cebu,"Almost all of survey was inside MPA. Mostly dead coral, with some soft coral."
90,Salag,Cebu,"More green algae, as at Moabug #89. Limestone cliff shoreline. Many anemones and anemonefish! Ended because we hit 2 hrs."
91,Camow-buan,Cebu,This a proposed MPA. Patches of digitate branching corals.
92,Poblacion Tabogon,Cebu,This is a proposed MPA. Passed the Tagasa building where we're staying. Ended near the end of Survey #92.
93,Lapus-lapus,Cebu,"Dive site. Soft coral in beginning, massive corals & rubble at end. Distant blasting heard, perhaps Gato Is. Strong currents."
94,Bantigue,Cebu,Scattered hard substrate wth mostly soft corals. Mostly sand. Densest corals at the beginning. Ended within sight of survey #94.
95,Dakit-dakit,Cebu,"Coral in beginning, sand at end. Started at dive site near small rock stack at Malapascua's SW corner. High relief with good coral cover. Then headed SE and offshore of survey site (to find deeper water). Found sand and some coral substrate."
96,Bagay,Cebu,"Distant from shore, but not tacot (apparently). Lots of massive, branching coral, and foliose corals, but very few fish of any kind. Feels like a ghost town. Many Diadema urchins. Distant blasts heard."
97,Bagay Tacot,Cebu,"Started on patchy corals, but these ran out, leaving us on sand with very sparse corals. Saw a strange anemone (HECR?) that looked whithered."
98,Tuminhow,Cebu,Offshore ridge on the offshore side. Corals all deep (6+m). Lots of branching and massive corals. A fisherman recommended this spot for its corals. Saw a new spp of pipefish! Blasts very close (0.5 km).
99,Tabatongan,Cebu,"Good live coral cover, many anemonefish. No corals deeper (all sand). GS saw 4 pipefish (not recorded on data sheet). MLP saw 3 pipefish (recorded)."
100,Bagay 2,Cebu,200m offshore. Saw a large (150cm) seasnake. Many ENQD but no PRBI.
101,Tuminhow 2,Cebu,"Sand at beginning, branching and massive corals at end. Tried to find corals on tacot, but ended up on mostly sand until we hit the offshore slope (5-10m) with good corals near survey #99. Few anemones."
