0,Field of Study,"Demography is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings. As a very general science, it can analyse any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space . Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, ageing, and death. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.Demographic analysis can cover whole societies, or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though there are a number of independent demography departments.Formal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.",,,,Demography

WHAT IS DEMOGRAPHY?

Demography is the scientific study of human population dynamics.  The size and the structure of populations are constantly changing in response to shifting fertility, mortality and migration trends. Demographic analyses provide deeper insights into how populations evolve over time and space at the national, regional, state and local levels. As a subject, demography extends beyond the traditional approaches to analysing vital statistics and include systematic examination of interaction between population and development addressing critical issues such as poverty, health, environment, economy and technology.   An understanding of demographic processes and statistical analysis is vital in the construction of policy in contemporary societies. 

The kinds of questions demographers seek to answer include the following, each of which relates to a critical issue that is shaping the modern world:

•	how will continued population growth affect our planet?
•	how can we stop mothers dying in Africa while giving birth?
•	how do we lift the poorest nations out of poverty?
•	how can we reduce uncertainty in population projections?
•	what can be done to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic?
•	why does the UK have one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe?
•	what is the impact of urbanisation on people and the planet?
WHAT IS SOCIAL STATISTICS?

Life is full of uncertainty. Decision-making, whether in the context of a commercial venture, medical practice or forming social policy, is inherently risky. To reduce the risk of making the wrong decision, we need information and hard evidence.  

It is statisticians who provide the data and analysis on which decisions can be made.  The academic researchers at the Division are internationally known for their expertise in the application of cutting-edge quantitative and qualitative methods. Much of our work has global impact, aiding our partners in the development of policy worldwide.
WHAT WILL I LEARN?

Our degrees in social statistics and demography help students to develop a comprehensive understanding of population issues in societies all over the world. We focus on the development of both qualitative and quantitative research skills – for which Southampton has an internationally renowned reputation. In particular, we have links with the United Nations (UN) UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS), the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank and the Office of National Statistics (ONS).


Our programmes will help you to understand the issues shaping local, national and global policy in the twenty first century. One of the distinctive features of our degree programmes is the practical focus – you will learn work-based skills that will prepare you for a range of professional careers.

12,Interest,"As of October 15, 2016, the United States has a total resident population of 324,707,000, making it the third most populous country in the world. It is very urbanized, with 81% residing in cities and suburbs as of 2014 (the worldwide urban rate is 54%). California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward. New York City is the most populous city in the United States.The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2015 is 1.84 children per woman, which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1. Compared to other Western countries, in 2012, U.S. fertility rate was lower than that of France (2.01), Australia (1.93) and the United Kingdom (1.92). However, U.S. population growth is among the highest in industrialized countries, because the differences in fertility rates are less than the differences in immigration levels, which are higher in the U.S. The United States Census Bureau shows a population increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012. Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%.",,,,Demography of the United States
13,Education,"Der Arbeitskreis ""Junior Research Group Demography"" hat das Ziel die Zusammenarbeit junger Wissenschaftler aus dem Forschungsbereich der Demographie und den interdisziplinären Anschlussbereichen zu fördern und die Sichtbarkeit der DGD gerade bei jungen Forschern zu erhöhen. Dies schließt die inhaltliche Zusammenarbeit und Vernetzung zwischen Personen, Gruppen und Instituten auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene ein.  Dazu sollen Tagungen und Workshops in wechselnder Kooperation mit Universitäten und wissenschaftlichen Instituten durchgeführt werden. Der thematische Fokus erstreckt über alle Teilaspekte der Demographie (Fertilität, Migration, Mortalität, formale Demographie) und deren interdisziplinäre Anschlussfelder. Um den wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs zu fördern, sollen zudem weitere wissenschaftliche Präsentationsformate (z.B. Poster) im Rahmen von Tagungen und Workshops etabliert werden, die es jungen Wissenschaftlern und Studierenden ermöglichen, auch erste (Teil-)Ergbnisse von Dissertationen, Abschlussarbeiten und kleineren Projekten vorzustellen. Neben der Vernetzung soll die universitäre Ausbildung im Bereich der Demographie im Fokus des Arbeitskreises stehen. Unsere Zielgruppe ist dabei weder auf das tatsächliche noch auf das akademische Alter beschränkt. 

The Working Group ""Junior Research Group Demography"" promotes the collaboration of young researchers from the scientific discipline of demography and its related research areas. The visibility of the DGD (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Demographie) should be enhanced, especially among young researchers. Therefore networks are established and cooperation as regards content between individuals, groups and research institutions at the national and international level will be supported. For this purpose the Working Group organizes conferences and workshops in alternating cooperation with universities and research institutes. All aspects of demographic research (fertility, migration, mortality, formal demography) and their related research areas are covered. Alternative formats of presentation (e.g. posters) are intended to be established on conferences and workshops to enable young researchers to present preliminary or partial results from dissertation projects, degree theses and smaller projects. Besides networking, another focus of the Working Group is on university training in demography. Our target group is neither limited to the actual age nor to the academic age.

18,Organization,"Our major focus is continuing a long-term demographic study at Hakalau Forest NWR, with the goal of gathering demographic estimates for native and non-native forest birds. Three of these species are endangered (Akepa, Akiapola'au, and Hawai'i Creeper) and a 4th is likely to be listed as endangered in the coming years (I'iwi). Ultimately, this research will give us information to estimate survivorship, productivity, and movement which are the key components for understanding population dynamics. These demographic parameters will then be compared with past studies to determine if there have been changes over time. This information is also critical for building ecological models that allow us to evaluate future threats to birds and determine the effectiveness of certain management actions. Here is a link to a report on the first two years of the productivity (nest monitoring) study, which explains some of the preliminary findings: http://hilo.hawaii.edu/hcsu/documents/HCSU_TR56_Paxton_Hakalau_Productivity.pdf",,,,Hawaii Forest Bird Demography Project
19,Interest,"The demographic features of the population of Japan include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects regarding the population.Based on the census from October 2010, Japan's population was at one of its peaks – 128,057,352. As of 2015 the population estimate was 127,110,000 making it the world's tenth-most populous country at the time. Mexico's population was slightly less than Japan's in 2015, with projections suggesting Mexico will soon pass Japan. Current statistics do not indicate much difference in population numbers. Japan's population size can be attributed to high growth rates experienced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Since 2010, Japan has experienced net population loss due to falling birth rates and almost no immigration, despite having one of the highest life expectancies in the world at 81.25 years of age as of 2006. Using the annual estimate for October of each year, the population peaked in 2008 at 128,083,960 and had fallen 285,256 by October 2011. Japan's population density was 336 people per square kilometer.Based on 2012 data from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, Japan's population will keep declining by about one million people every year in the coming decades, which will leave Japan with a population of 42 million in 2110. By that time, more than 40% of the population is expected to be over age 65 in 2060. In 2012, the population had for six consecutive years declined by 212,000, the largest drop on record since 1947 and also a record low of 1.03 million births. In 2014, a new record of population drop happened with 268,000 people. In 2013, more than 20 percent of the population are age 65 and over.",,,,Demography of Japan
