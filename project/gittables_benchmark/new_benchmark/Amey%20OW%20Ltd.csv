•	Review of existing permit arrangements for residents and businesses. This review will not include provision for charging for residents and visitor permits, which are currently free of charge.
•	Maximising on-street parking provision, and therefore revenue, to meet the increasing parking demand for visitors, businesses and also commuters where appropriate. It is not proposed to introduce significant areas of residents parking areas but where this may be necessary then any new schemes will need to comply with Liverpool's Residents Parking Policy.
