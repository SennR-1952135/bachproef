0,Schroeder,MN,"For sale: $499,000. As you come into Minnesota's most northern county, right on the edge of Lake Superior is Magney Ln. A beautiful country road tucked below the highway above some of the sweetest ledge-rock shoreline around. The setting is natural: pure Superior landscape. Amongst it is a perfect getaway place.  Or make this your dream home. The home is nestled in the woods: nice for experiencing nature and no landscaping to worry about. Stone steps lead to the shoreline which is flat and accessible.  Pockets of beach rock come and go, rearranging just so after each day's series of waves do their artwork. Brave ones will plunge into the crystal waters and run up to the fire pit for a well-deserved s'more or all the way into the living room's roaring fireplace.  There are a few sprawling decks overlooking the whole seen. Fix up some food in the spacious and well appointed kitchen and spend summer meals on the decks. In winter, cozy up in the dining area attached to the kitchen or lounge around in the living room regaling each other with tales of previous North Shore adventures. Lots of room for each and everyone: four bedrooms, three baths. Or, make the place your refuge: you can make two of those bedrooms &quot;his and her&quot; offices. Every room looks to the big lake for inspiration and relaxation.  Hidden away in this well built home, watching the wonder of a Nor'easter brings the mind to a new place, the elemental powers working their wonders. There's a super cool community wood-fired oven up on Magney Ln. Berries in summer, chopping firewood in the fall, woodsmoke and reading in the winter and the loosening ice of Superior in the Spring with all those warblers finding their way north from the tropics. Closer to the Twin Cities and Duluth, yet close to all that Cook County has to offer. Grab a coffee, Danish and some local intel at the Schroeder Pantry just up the road. Walk right from this home to the trailhead for Caribou Falls, then just keep goin' on the Superior Hiking Tr. Miles of XC skiing lay out groomed and glistening nearby. Snowmobiling trails close. Hit the Lutsen Mt slopes. Mt Bike the newly made Jackpot Trail off Britton Peak all the way to Mystery Mt! Then return to home, your place. The new base on Gitche Gummee. The place and vibe will sink in, reorienting the body and mind to what really matters: family, outdoors, time off and away!"

2,Schroeder,MN,"For sale: $599,900. Old World charm and craftsmanship meet 300' of Lake Superior beach, on 4.36 acres! Hard to find these large, secluded properties these days. Tucked down and secluded, this home was creatively and lovingly built as the private getaway of one of the Northshore's premier builders. The architectural detailing is fairy tale. The vibe is timeless, combined with ease of spirit and mind. Come down to the beach to begin your virtual tour: sand, cobbles and gravel arc along Gitche Gumee's sweet water. The cobbles form a color chart of miles of local geology, swirled together and set just-so after each churning. Turn now to a bench of land, a natural buildsite tucked below another slope far from the highway. In early times it would be an ideal camp. In the late 70s our builder knew he found the ideal locale, so he put up a dream he had: the main home just the right size and a guest cabin, each bedecked in all the little matters that count.  Carved birds soar out of the gables, there's scrollwork, tin filigree, a sauna. The fireplaces, those beach cobbles came in handy, each a masterpiece - roaring delights. Step inside: hard wood floors, paneled ceilings with Northwoods detailing, a screen porch for drinks, laughter, contemplation. The kitchen looks over the Big Lake for inspiration: fried herring! The living room fits everyone for charades, gin-rummy, or heck have Christmas here! Head out the front door and upslope into the woods. The conifers keep the world at bay, a handmade gate for the ages says this is the place! Come back down the driveway and take a second look. It's sinking in now, this is the one. That's how the current owners reacted when they bought it.  They've loved it up and now look to the next stewards to do the same. Come have a look, just down the road from Schroeder, close to the mighty Caribou River. Unwind, relax, poke around a bit. See if your dreams and goals fall into place here."
