0,,,en,,"<p>Bowers has used hierarchical cluster analysis heatmap to cluster k-12 students, with elementary, middle, and high school cumulative grades as variables for clustering. He has also attempted to correlated clusters with categorical variables such as dropout, ACT taking status, gender, and district. He compared heatmaps produced from GPA of different grades.</p> <p>From the heatmap, it is easy to find how many cluster there are based on the different colors of GPA's. It is also easy to find correlation between clusters and variables such as dropout, ACT taking, gender, and district. The higher students' GPA's are, the less likely they will drop out and the more likely they will have taken ACT.</p>",,
1,,,en,,"<p>This article introduces concepts, data collection and processing, methods, and analysis surrounding social network analysis (SNA), meanwhile providing resources for further study and research. Although having used a small dataset of a class, the case has illustrated the whole process of SNA. The case shows how to carry out descriptive, exploratory data analysis, as well as potential explanatory analysis concerning relationship between actor position in the network and education outcomes. Through comparing the two sociographs for the first and second exams, we may find obvious difference in terms of density and transitivity. We may also compare pattern changes in factors like gender, study group, and performance by observing shapes associated with these factors.</p> <p>The further exploration of change patterns for each group via the parallel coordinate plot can illustrate overall changes from exam 1 to exam 2. A similar, but more complex, visualization tool is a loomchart.</p> <p>For now, the SNA technique has developed advanced methods to test statistical hypotheses, as mentioned by the article. This is good for exploration of more complicated relationship.</p>",,
2,,,,,"<p>It is possible to use online learning data to promote individualistic learning for students, but this is possible constrained by some conditions. Of course, with education data covering each student, teachers can know a student's idiosyncratic learning styles and provide this student with tailored advice in terms of how to effectively grasp the stuff the teacher is teaching. But this is only possible when the class size is not too big so that the teacher has the time to analyze and interpret the meaning behind the data and communicate with students to confirm the teacher's understanding of the data. If the the class contains, say, 50 students, the teacher will end up getting herself or himself too busy with dealing with education data, deprived of time to think about how to improve her or his teaching itself. With a big class in hand, the teacher may have to leave each student analyzing her data by herself. When this occurs, we never know how effective a role data will play in boosting individualistic education.</p> <p>Â </p>",,
3,,,en,,"<p>This article shows the working mechanisms of a Bayesian cognitive model used in an intelligence tutoring system. The model simultaneously interacts with the students in their process of taking exercises, calculating the probability of their having mastered the skills underlying each problem they have done and determining whether to let students pass or giving them more exercises for practice. This system has a high internal validity as well a high external validity. That is, they are applicable to tests where students do the work by themselves without interacting with the tutor.</p> <p>The advantage of this Bayesian system lies in its ability to incorporate previous empirical information, i.e., whether students have done the exercises wrongly or rightly in the prior problems, its ability to use individualized parameters for each student, and its ability to adopt slipping and guessing parameters.</p>",,
4,978-1-4503-1111-3,ACM,,,"<p>This essay is a good summary of the similarities and difference between educational data mining and learning analytics. They have a lot of similarities: Researchers in both areas learn machine learning concepts and attempt to explore patterns behind data in education. On the other hand, an essential difference lies in their purpose: Whereas data miners aim at data and techniques, learning analysts more focus on using data to help education practitioners to improve teaching. I agree with the authors' opinion that researchers in both areas should learn from each other and improve their respective research.</p>",,
5,,O'Reily Media,,,"<p>This article briefly summarizes the diagnostic measures for three types of algorithms in data mining, including classification, ranking, and regression. Each type has several different metrics which have different focuses and thus advantages and disadvantages. The article closes with caveats for problems with the data that may render the metrics problematic. The important thing in using theses measures is to realize each one's features and select appropriate one(s) for specific purposes.</p>",,
6,,,,,"<p>I agree that to measure learning is difficult, but this does not mean that it is impossible to give up measuring learning altogether. One difficulty lies with measuring learning process, but actually there are growth mixture models and a host of longitudinal models aimed to measure students' progression in terms of some education outcomes. Another effort has been made by Dr. Bowers in Teachers College who has managed to map students' overall academic information in heatmaps and Hilbert curves. More valuable, successful attempts will appear in the future. So, instead of complaining about futility of measuring learning, let us put more effort in devising effective means of measuring learning itself.</p>",,
7,,,,,"<p>This comic satirizes the current practice of forcing middle and high school students to learn math and then using standardized tests to examine their performance and punish those teachers who have not helped students to improve on such tests. The comic also implies that education policy makers may have confused correlation with causation. Entering engineering fields is correlated with being good at math, but may not be caused by that. The real cause may be interest and motivation which determine both entering into engineering career and good performance in math. This is shown in the comic where a child likes playing clocks because she likes engineering and you cannot force a child to enter engineering by forcing her to play with clocks.</p>",,
8,,,,,"<p>This cheatsheet is very helpful, especially when it comes to dealing with data processing. Before viewing this cheatsheet, I only knew ""join"" and related methods to concatenate different datasets, but now I have the two powerful tools of tidyr and dplyr. The only thing is that I need to practice with the dozens of specific commands in the sheet before I can skillfully use them to process data.</p>",,
9,,ACM,,,<p>The practices of hiring data wranglers to help interpret education data for education practitioners is inspiring. I was especially impressed by the fact that a wrangler wrote a 20-30-page report each month and helped administrators to interpret education data when the need arose. The data wranglers analyzed ranged from a small bar chart to education big data. I agree that such a job of data wrangling is very necessary for teachers and policy makers who may not know much about how to explore the meaning behind various types of data.</p>,,
10,,,,,"<p>This article discusses both the dangers and potential of personalized learning. A main problem mentioned is the lack of a definition for this type of learning. Without a definition, it will be rather difficult to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of personalized learning. If it is defined as letting students choose whatever they like to learn, of course the learning outcome will probably not optimistic since students tend to learn only easy or interested stuff.</p> <p>Two issues arising in the comments of this article are worth discussion. First, motivation of learning may take a large weight in deciding the learning outcome. With low motivation, it will be not easy to help students learn what they do not like. For those students, the first thing be to increase motivation first. Second, personalized learning does not necessarily mean that they may get more attention from teachers, which however tend to decide the learning outcome. One on one study is available only to the elite, and teachers need to pay sufficient attention to students even when they are using personalized teaching style.</p>",,
11,,Youtube,,,"<p>This short introduction to feature selection discusses two main reasons why we want to carry out this process. One reason is for interpretation and insight (knowledge discovery), and the other is for solving the dimensionality curse problem.</p>",,
12,,,,,"<p>The most useful information in this cheatsheet concerns shiny R and formats. I've known something about Rmarkdown before, but that is limited to basic commands and formats. This cheatsheet tells me how to produce tales in Rmarkdown and produce Latex format text. This is very useful to someone who may need to produce clean format of math equations in papers.</p>",,
13,,,,,"<p>This articles gives a generic framework for learning<br />analytics which contains six dimensions, like data, stakeholders, and objective. The meaningfulness of this framework is that it connects relevant parties in education and illuminates how these parties are connected around the area of learning analytics. As mentioned by the authors, this framework is not intended to be perfect and applicable to every scenario in education, but that education practitioners may revise this framework and make it useful to their specific purposes.</p>",,
14,,,,,"<p>This is a comprehensive study on a MOOC course on recommendation system by the computer science department of University of Minnesota. PCA analysis is limited to Section 4.4 Preliminary Analyses where the authors explored reasons why students registered this course and found four factors with eigenvalues over 1.</p> <p>But the essay is not limited to PCA. It did many regression analyses, attempting to figure out variables significantly predicting outcomes such asÂ  final grades and retention (five months after the course ended). The authors also compared face-to-face students and online students, with the former commonly prevailing on the outcomes they studied. Yet, the authors gave caveats that the small size of the former group of students might have made the results not statistically convincing.</p> <p>This article more than showed details of researching PCA or even MOOC courses. It also discussed interactions from students, the qualitative part. Some students applied what they learned to their businesses or work immediately out of a specific lesson. This shows the utility of this recommendation system course.</p>",,
15,,International Educational Data Mining Society,en,,"<p>This article introduces an automatic way of finding out the Q matrix of item-skill correspondence. The new method is more complex than the currently popular LFA method, incorporating several machine learning algorithms such as matrix factorization, bag-of-words modeling, and clustering. The method also uses AFM or BKT method.</p> <p>I noticed two potential areas for further study: Add bag-of-words keyword information to expand the V-matrix, and explore whether AFM vs. BKT favors different search algorithms. These two areas are interesting. The first study may further automize the proposed method, making it possible to reduce participation from humans. The second study can provide suggestions as to which search algorithm needs which evaluation criterion.</p>",,
16,,,,,"<p>This chapter focuses on basic concepts and issues around social network analysis (SNA). More specifically, emphasis is given to difference between conventional inferential statistics and descriptive statistics involving SNA. This chapter also describes SNA's data collection methods and scales of data measurement.</p> <p>An interesting topic lies in the Note section where the authors briefly discusses methods to test hypotheses using random sampling methods.</p>",,
17,978-0-9952408-0-3,,EN,,"<p>This article is a general introduction to the process of data visualization in education. It is helpful to know that this process starts from researchers having questions, with visualization itself beginning from sketching on a paper or blackboard before moving to visualization libraries like d3.js and Processing. Especially inspiring is the multiple realization of the difference between the two numbers, 37 and 75. To obtain a more detailed understanding of how to visualize data in learning analytics, we need to learn specific techniques.</p>",,
18,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,"<p>For me who major in measurement and evaluation, this article has provided a systematic review of the theories and other relevant issues in psychometrics. This articles has done a brief yet comprehensive review of classical testing theory, IRT, CFA, DCM, GMM, and other models commonly used in measurement research. The value of this paper far extends the implied scope in the title ""learning analytics"": Anyone interested in psychometrics and intends to have a general understanding of this area will probably find this article a valuable reference and a good starting point.</p> <p>The author is justified in terms of reviewing concepts and theories in psychometrics for learning analytics researchers. After all, measurement is a prerequisite for any researcher intended to carry out an empirical study. To test a hypothesis which involves relationship between concepts, researchers first need to know how to operationalize these concepts before they may be able to empirically test their relationship.</p>",,
19,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR),,,"<p>This article is a general introduction to issues of predictive modeling in education. It refers to data collection, feature engineering, common algorithms, diagnostic measures of model evaluation, and challenges and opportunities for researchers in the area of predictive modeling. An inspiring categorization of data is time-based, state-based, and event-driven. This division can help us to better understand the difference of our data.</p> <p>A suggestion the authors gave on how to deal with missing data may be controversial. They suggested using common values (e.g., mean) or values of similar data points, but statisticians have warned against using such methods. They may narrow the standard deviation or have other problems. Instead, the missing values may be computed with appropriate algorithms if the missing patterns are completely random.</p>",,
20,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research,EN,,"<p>This article attempts to specify ethic principles for the newly emerged field of learning analytics. This effort is worthwhile and necessary since former ethic rules, although providing some insight for learning analytics, may be not applicable good enough. The introduction of the history of ethics for learning analytics is informative, allowing us to trace the history back to the Open University, the operation of which accumulates a large amount of data and makes it necessary to lay down rules concerning how to protect the data of the University's students. The article mentions ethic principles established by many different institutions and conferences, which means that for now there still lacks a popular set of rules acceptable to most, if not all, learning analytics researchers and practitioners. Anyhow, a good point of this article is that in the future interested organizations may refer to this article for inspiration when they need to establish their own ethic rules. Perhaps one day learning analytics institutions' leaders may sit together and produce a set of rules covering almost all possible uses of education data.</p>",,
21,978-0-9952408-0-3,Society for Learning Analytics Research,EN,,"<p>The authors aim to promote explanatory modeling efforts in the area of educational data mining, an area long prevalent with predictive modeling attempts. The focus is on cognitive model discovery where researchers use Q-matrix (including KC's) and AFM to discover new KC's that have better fit than expert-defined KC's. The article mentions three models: DFA, LFA, and SimStuden (software). By comparing results to models only with expert efforts, the authors found that the automated cognitive models have better fits.</p> <p>The conclusion of this article is balanced. The authors emphasize the role of experts in exploring cognitive models, which they believe tends to make the derived models more interpretable, although another article in the reading of several weeks ago promotes totally automated modeling.</p> <p>For interpretability, the authors have included both understanding why and how: Why some variables should be included, and how the results can help to improve instructions. Of course, the authors also stress that both independent and dependent variables should correspond to constructs.</p>",,
22,,,,,"<p>The authors have revised a poor graph and represented it with R as an appealing graph illustrating information interesting to potential readers. The usefulness of this article is that it has spelled out principles in terms of purpose of the graph, revision guidelines, and guidelines for multiple graphs.</p>",,
23,,,,,"<p>Knowing how to produce poor-quality graphs helps us to notice bad practices and thus attempt to avoid these practices when we are drawing our own graphs. Some principles in this article are objective: Data density index, Perceptual distortion, and Data-ink ratio, whereas other rules may be subjective but insightful. Perhaps, I can summarize some of the author's rules with names like ""simplicity, consistency, clarity, efficiency, context, focus, sufficiency, label, and alternative"". These principles are similar to those in academic writing.</p>",,
24,,,,,"<p>This article clarifies the difference between the goal of discovery and communication in data visualization, with the former being the main goal of statisticians and the latter of Infovis experts. More specifically, statisticians prefer traditional graphical means, such as scatterplots, lines, and bars, to make comparisons, whereas Infovis people favor unique, creative design of graphs to catch audience's attention. The argument of the authors that statisticians should focus on making comparisons, presenting information, and discovering patterns from data is convincing, and this cogency of argument is reflected in the multitude of examples in the article. Many so-called ""best"" graphs from the Infovis world, although able to catch attention, are no use in giving much information about the data. Finally, the author's suggestion that experts from both fields should learn from each other is a helpful attempt to bridge the gap between the graphs from both groups.</p>",,
25,,,,Blog,"<p>It is insightful for the author to divide poor quality graphics into categories according to differing combinations of three factors--questions, data, and visualization. The examples are illustrative to some extent, but may not be illuminating owing to lacking the context where these graphs appeared. By only looking at the graphs, we may find it difficult to find out what questions these graphs are aimed to answer, why the data are improper, or why the visual effect is poor. If the goals of the graph producers are different from understanding of the author, different judgment of their quality may arise.</p>",,
26,,,,,"<p>One interesting point of this introduction is how to determine the number of clusters for a dataset. One is F-test, and the other is proportional reduction in error (PRE). It is good to have an applet to show the working mechanism of clustering, but it cannot be viewed on my computer.</p>",,
