3,CHILD & YOUTH FINANCE INTERNATIONAL,"Poverty is a global challenge. It has so many enduring effects on people, their communities and their countries.
CYFI sees that that the key to fighting poverty is for people to learn how to manage and handle money, and have the confidence, knowledge and responsibility to spend and earn it responsibly. This must start from childhood.
So CYFI has partnered with thousands of organizations in over 150 countries around the world – from banks, to governments, to NGOs, to academics – you name it! Together, they work to create policies and programs that make children and youth able to learn about money, have access to a bank account, develop entrepreneurial skills and, most importantly, to believe in themselves.",Amsterdam,The Netherlands

Cure Violence is a unique, interdisciplinary, health approach to violence prevention. We maintain that the problem of violence is solvable, like other epidemics, when we understand that violence behaves like an infectious disease and treat violence using health disease control methods. Our approach to stopping shootings, killings and other lethal events includes detecting and interrupting the “transmission” of these potentially violent events; identifying and changing the infectivity (i.e., the thinking and behavior) of the highest potential transmitters (i.e., those most highly involved in violence); and changing community, city and region-wide norms and social expectations so that violence is no longer used in response to differing or conflicting views or interests.","Chicago, IL",USA
8,DANISH REFUGEE COUNCIL,"“The Danish Refugee Council is a private independent organization whose aim is to protect refugees and internally displaced persons from persecution and promote lasting solutions to refugee problems on the basis of humanitarian principles and human rights.” (DRC statutes section 2.1)
DRC National level:

Legal counseling to asylum seekers
Safeguarding the rights of refugees and a decent asylum treatment
Advocacy and voicing our opinions e.g. on new legislation
Integration of refugees and immigrants
Our 7.100 active volunteers help refugees find foothold in Denmark
Support to voluntary repatriation

DRC International:

In acute crisis we save lives and alleviate the immediate suffering
In displacement we promote people’s rights to protection and strengthen their livelihoods
We promote durable solutions to displacement
We strengthen local capacities and advocate for rights
We create environments free from threats of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms & light weapons
We second trained specialists to UN organizations from our emergency Roster

DRC – full circle of displacement:
Danish Refugee Council is unique in assisting refugees and displaced along every phase of the displacement axes. Even though the displacement patterns differ individually, the same displaced would in principle meet DRC in all stages of a full circle of displacement.
A Syrian internally displaced from the present crisis would receive emergency relief inside Syria, then shelter and cash relief as a refugee in Lebanon, then protection in transit in Greece and Serbia, then benefit of our European advocacy efforts at EU level, then through legal advice in Denmark during the asylum process, then through the support to integrate in Denmark, then through advice and support if wishing to return and finally in the form of livelihood and long-term solutions once back in Syria – in addition to the ability to live in an environment no longer contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance, cleared by DDG.
See more about our assistance framework in section 04 in The International Humanitarian work of the Danish Refugee Council 2015-2016 – https://drc.ngo/media/2437835/drc-international_2015-2016_introductory-folder.pdf
As a private humanitarian organisation, DRC’s work covers all aspects of refugee issues based on humanitarian principles and human rights. Our overarching mission is to assist and protect refugees and to empower them towards a better future.
We strive to provide sustainable solutions for refugees, displaced people and host communities coupled with the objective of enabling those we assist to live dignified lives.

10,GAME,"GAME’s mission is to create lasting social change through youth-led street sports and culture. The nonprofit’s programs seek to integrate vulnerable ethnic-minority youth (refugees, immigrants, etc.) into the community and offers the opportunity for them to grow as peer-educators and drivers of social change in a local setting (Playmakers). The activities are targeted young people in less-advantaged neighborhoods in Denmark, Lebanon, and Somaliland and span across ethnic, religious, and social divides. In 2016 GAME had more 100,000 visits at its practices, tournaments, workshops, and open gyms in 42 neighborhoods in Denmark and Lebanon. Furthermore GAME has scaled its impact over the last three years by providing micro grants worth 1.5 mill. USD to a total of 355 youth-led street sports projects outside the organization.
Seeing how marginalized youth from ethnic minorities could be brought together with resourceful youth and find common ground around basketball, dance, parkour and football, GAME turned to the idea of using sports as a vehicle for social change.
GAME was founded in 2002 and through the years the organization has gained extensive experiences, which has allowed for the development of innovative methods to increase the development aspects of the activities. One such initiative is an English and Arabic basketball compendium that introduces three levels of empowerment (individual, social and community), with a series of corresponding training themes (leadership, trust, democracy, etc.). With an open-source strategy this helps the organization scale its impact and strengthen the whole field of Sport for Development and Peace.
In January 2016 the nonprofit opened the doors for its second indoor facility for street sports – GAME Esbjerg. After the first year of operations, the 3.4 mill. USD facility had attracted more than 3,500 members of all ages and become the largest sports initiative in Denmark’s fifth largest city. With GAME Esbjerg and GAME Copenhagen (awarded the IOC/IAKS prize) as inspiration, the establishment of the two next facilities in Aalborg and Viborg opens in february and March 2018.
With new funding to start up in four countries in EU the (Lithuania, Greece, Malta, and Italy), GAME will also be opening new indoor facilities as well as outdoor facilities for street sports in across Europe, The Middle East and Africa.
In Beirut the innovative campaign “Looking for a Place to Dream” has advocated for more public space for play and helped the politicians acknowledge the need. A new street sports facility intended to curb the growing tensions between the Syrian refugees and the hosting communities is now under way.",Copenhagen,Denmark
11,GENERATIONS FOR PEACE,"We believe a more peaceful world is possible. We want to make it happen, now and for future generations. 
We believe in active tolerance and that embracing diversity is a strength. We’re concerned about a growing culture of division, prejudice and hate. We see people struggling to relate to each another and failing to respond to conflict and disputes without resorting to violence.

12,iDE,"iDE creates income and livelihood opportunities for poor, rural households. We turn $1 dollar into $12.30 in income for a small entrepreneur with business models that work.
iDE is an international non-profit organization dedicated to creating income and livelihood opportunities for the rural poor. As one of the first organizations to unlock the power of markets to fight poverty, iDE is a pioneer.  Today, market-based development is widely recognized as a sustainable, scaleable, cost-effective approach to alleviate poverty. iDE has impacted more than 23 million people globally to date through its WASH and Agriculture Initiatives, and has an ambitious plan to double that number by 2020.
 
Our Values:

Poor women and men have the right to a secure livelihood.
Markets are the most powerful force for significant, widespread and lasting impact on rural prosperity.
The rural poor are customers, producers, and entrepreneurs.
We listen to and learn from the people we work with.
We value innovation and entrepreneurship.
We are results-oriented, aiming for significant impacts for large numbers of people.
We strive for economic, social, and environmental
equity and sustainability.

 
How do we do this?
Start with People
We believe that people can work their way out of poverty if they have business opportunities that are designed specifically with them in mind. That means client input is number one. With a human-centered innovation lab in-house, we highly value a deep understanding of the people we serve. It’s the farmers, the entrepreneurs, and the households themselves that inspire our solutions.
Design to Context
Markets are different all over the world, and our solutions follow suit. We might be exploring hydrated lime to treat fecal sludge, or developing an SMS information system to deliver competitive prices to farmers in the field, or something else. But it’s never boring. Our structure is intentionally decentralized to allow for visionary leadership on the ground, not just back at headquarters.
Business Delivers
In essence, we adapt business practices for high-constraint environments. We do this in economies with little to no labor, manufacturing or finance sectors. Visit our country offices, and you will hear conversations about sales incentive strategies, the consumer purchase experience, and business performance metrics. Walk with our field staff, and you will see individuals who are as effective and efficient as any business people you’ve met.
Results Rule
It’s in our DNA to be uncomfortable with the status quo. And data is one of our most powerful tools to shake things up. It allows us to critically reflect on what we’re doing, and helps us to make better decisions. Whether we’re testing a hypothesis in a controlled petri dish, or validating anecdotal evidence in a way that’s rigorous and defensible—data is king.","Denver, CO",USA

14,LANDESA,"Landesa champions and works to secure land rights for millions of the world’s poorest women and men to provide opportunity and promote social justice.
Most of the world’s poorest people share three traits: they live in rural areas; they rely on the land to survive; and they have insecure rights to the land they rely on.
Their insecure rights over their most important asset — land — casts a long shadow over their lives.
Without secure rights to land, farmers do not have the security, incentive, and opportunity to make the long-term investments in their land that boost agricultural production and income.
Landesa partners with governments and local organizations to strengthen land rights for women and men at scale. Laws, policies, and programs bring transformational changes on a large scale. Once families and communities have the security, stability, and opportunity provided by land rights, other important development interventions — like education, clean water, and nutrition — can take hold.
Landesa works in the regions of the world where extreme generational poverty is most prevalent and therefore the potential impact greatest: India, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, and, most recently, Myanmar.
Because Landesa partners with governments, their work is durable and leveraged, with hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions of women and men benefiting from a new innovative program or progressive law.
Over the last 50 years, working in more than 50 countries, Landesa has helped strengthen land rights for more than 120 million families.","Seattle, WA",USA
