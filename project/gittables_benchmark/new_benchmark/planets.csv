0,Mercury,"A small hot planet a stone throw from the Earthlings. No rings, moons or atmosphere to block your view of the sky. Perfect for anyone looking for lots of iron and not much else. You must be okay with extremes though as temperatures range from -180 to 430°C. If you stay here also watch out for the day/night cycle as a single day is shorter than the whole year!",300
