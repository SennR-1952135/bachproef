Processes are executed for a predefined unit of time called a quantum. Once the CPU executes the process for the specified time slice, the process either terminates or returns to the back of the ready queue if the process has any remaining burst time left. Numerous proposals have been made to improve the static quantum time of the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm; most research focuses on the optimization of the ready queue. In this paper, I proposed having predefined optimized quantum times for most process that can be retrieved whenever a new process enters the ready queue.",Java

Clock and Least recently Used (LRU) are applied for page replacement, where each process can have a maximum 50 pages. When a page fault handling occurs, the interrupt routine will handle thw fault by placing an I/O requesto into a queue, which will later be processed by the I/O controller to bring the page into main memory. (Swapping in a page takes 6 units of time.) The system is to use a Round Robin short-term scheduling algorithm with time a quantum of Q. This project compares the performance differences between LRU ad clock page replacement algorithms for the fixed allocation with local replacement strategy.",Java
