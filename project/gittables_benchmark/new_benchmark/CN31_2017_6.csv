Sometimes study can start with <strong>individual cases</strong> and then go to the population level keeping all its complexity. Deal with data with caution!</p> <p>It would be good if each student has her/his own profile containing info not only about the weakness but also the strength, for example good at comprehension by graphs. Then instructors know how to modify and cater to students' taste.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Doubt:</span> Whether it is appropriate to compare students to pilots? Though students differ in various aspects but most of them linger around the average I believe? But it is still justifiable to design learning materials for the minorities.</p> <p>Besides, the lecturer is talking about higher edu? In elementary or high school level, it can be hard to set standard to evaluate students' learning if there are difference in learning materials. Possible solutions might be to gauge individual learning experiences and not set students to standardized tests.</p>; <p>Enlightening moments:</p> <blockquote> <p>“jagged profile” <span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Heuristica,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;""><br /></span></p> </blockquote> <p>Nobody is about average. Examples from pilots, we know that sometimes mean or median is not the population because everyone is individualized and are jagged. Jagged profile reveals the fact that the normal people is representing nobody.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Because our science textbook assumes every kid is reading on grade level, we’re in trouble,” he said in the talk. “For her, science class is first and foremost a reading test, and it’s doubtful that we will ever see what she’s truly capable of.”</p> </blockquote> <p> </p> <p> </p> <blockquote>It turns out your personality and your learning varies across contexts.</blockquote> <p> Context is very important in most conditions. Our goal is to explore the full potentials of every student. Therefore, context should be the major consideration as opposed to generalization.</p>",,
