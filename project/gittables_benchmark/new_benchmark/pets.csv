0,9,Male,"Luciano is a beautiful senior who's hoping to strike it big in the city with a family to call his own! This handsome 8-year-old fella doesn't need much to be happy and would be perfectly content lounging on your couch or by your side! Luciano wants to be the star of your show, and although he likes some other dogs around his size, he would do best as the only dog in the household. Although he is not outright reactive on leash, Luciano has trouble when first meeting dogs on the street, and would likely do better in a quieter neighborhood with less dog foot traffic. He is otherwise a very easy-going guy with a lot of love to give to his humans. Luciano is waiting for you at Animal Haven, please contact us directly to meet him!"

2,3,Male,"Meet Lance! This big goofball from Miami has a whole lot of love to go around! Lance is an excitable guy who would do best in an active home with experienced doggie pawrents. Lance can be weary around new people and it may take a few visits before he warms up to potential adopters. We don't know much about his past, but we understand he needs to take things slow. However, once you've gained his trust he is extremely loyal to his people and lives to please. He's an intelligent boy that has caught on to basics quickly, but suffers from some anxiety. Staff have been working on helping him become more confident and comfortable during his time here. Lance really values his toys and has a tendency to guard them, potential adopters will need to be open to continue his training to help him learn how to share. Lance does well with most other dogs and likes to play as long as other dogs don't come on too strong. Please contact Animal Haven if you'd like more information on Lance!"
3,3,Male,"Totopo was rescued from a terrible situation in Mexico where his rescuer found him tied on a chain so tight, he couldn't even lay down. His skin was in terrible condition from a bunch of different infections, he was lucky to be rescued when he was. Totopo has since made a full recovery but he bares the scars from his mistreatment. We can only assume what this sweet boy has gone through, but despite it all he still loves people and is a wiggly, playful guy. We encourage potential adopters to take it slow with Totopo - you wouldn't want a bear hug from someone you've just met after all! Totopo has a high prey drive and would do best as the only animal in the household. This handsome boy may have a rough exterior, but is a wonderful dog looking for a family he can trust not to hurt him again. If you'd like to give Totopo his second chance, please contact Animal Haven for more information."
4,15,Male,"Art ended up in the city shelter when his elderly owner needed to move and was unable to take Art with them. Art is blind and deaf and needs daily eye medication to counter his dry eyes. This sweet senior is a big lover and is so happy and affectionate when he finds someone! Because of his impairments, he often wanders around until he finds his place to settle - but he knows where his bed and dishes are as long as they don't move! He's also great at sniffing out wee-wee pads and does his best to aim for them! Art truly loves the company of other dogs and seems happiest in a busy place where he knows he's not alone. He loves burrowing under tons of blankets and always manages to fully cover himself when it's time for bed! Art is the best boy who needs a nice place to settle for the rest of his days. Have room in your heart for Art? Contact Animal Haven to learn more about this special senior!"
5,1,Male,"Gnocchi is a HIGH energy pup with a big personality! This energetic goofball came all the way from Alabama and is looking for an active family that loves playing as much as he does! Gnocchi is attentive, intelligent and highly food and toy motivated. He would benefit from experienced pawrents that have the time to focus on getting him into a routine and have the ability to work on his impulse control. Gnocchi would do best as the only animal in the household and is likely not a ""dog park dog."" Although he has a lot of his basics down, expect to put in some work on this pup! If you love long walks or have been looking for a hiking buddy, Gnocchi is the very good boy for you!"
6,3,Female,"Erin is a wonderful, loving and loyal girl who has significant anxiety. She forms a huge bond with her people if given the time to earn her trust. Erin is looking for an experienced dog guardian who is willing to continue her training to ease her anxiety. Her ideal home would be outside of the city where there are fewer environmental aspects to worry her. The shelter can be a stressful environment despite all efforts to make sure our animals are happy and comfortable. Erin receives daily training, meditation, and decompression time to ease her stress. Our training & behavior team has been working with her extensively and she has been making steady progress. At this point, we've done our utmost to make her comfortable, but she needs that 1-on-1 care to continue her journey of tackling her anxiety that we simply cannot provide in a shelter environment. If you are interested in meeting Erin, please contact Animal Haven and schedule a time to meet her."
7,3,Male,Enzo is new
8,5,Male,"Meet Clyde! This cuddle bug will be your new bestie as soon as you meet! Clyde is a friendly boy around people but does not like other dogs and would do best as the only animal in the household. Clyde's favorite activities include giving kisses, getting belly rubs, and lounging on the couch next to you! Clyde's potential adopters should be prepared for a dog that is not a ""dog park dog"" and is okay not saying ""hi"" to other pups in the neighborhood. If you're interested in a boy who wants to be the center of your attention, contact Animal Haven today!"
9,1,Male,"Monte lives with a condition called Megaesophagus. Essentially, Monte's esophagus is enlarged and doesn't function correctly to help keep his food down. Monte must sit in a special chair that keeps him upright in order to prevent him from regurgitating his food and he needs to stay upright for 10-15 minutes to ensure the food reaches his stomach. We've ordered him his own custom ""Bailey Chair"" and he hops right into it when it's meal time! This chair is adjustable and was measured so that he'll grow into it. His chair will come with him when he's adopted! Monte is a gleeful, playful puppy who otherwise lives a normal life. He LOVES toys and enjoys his ""party time"" in our training room where he runs out his zoomies. Although his condition prevents us from using treats to train, he's highly toy motivated and has been picking up basics like a pro! Potential adopters will need to be aware that Monte is on a special diet for his condition and currently has 3 meal times a day. If he accidentally ingests anything between those meal times, he will need to sit in his chair. He's a big puppy that will need consistent, unique training and supervision while he works on his impulse control! If you're interested in finding out more about Monte and his condition, please contact Animal Haven!"
10,6,Male,"This is Scrappy. His two favorite things are eating (and investigating what you're eating) and napping with you. He has empathetic and curious eyes, observing your movements and activity when you (strangely) choose to not cuddle with him. Surprisingly patient and confidently friendly, Scrappy is fundamentally social. You'll look forward to coming and being home knowing Scrappy is there to freely share his love."
11,1,Female,"Soave was rescued from a large hoarding situation where there were over 30 cats in the household. Although she is a little shy when first meeting new people, she's really blossomed here at Animal Haven! It doesn't take long for her to get to know you and she LOVES making biscuits with visitors she knows. Soave is so affectionate despite her previous circumstances, it just takes a little bit of lovin' to get there! Give this sweetheart a second chance, you won't regret it!"
12,12,Female,"Mayra ended up in the city shelter after her owner passed away many weeks ago from COVID-19. After being in a home her entire life, it has understandably been a huge adjustment. Mayra is no stranger to a home but, like many cats, needs a little time adjusting to new places. While she was initially very shy upon her arrival at Animal Haven, she has really opened up to be an affectionate lady. Mayra previous lived with another cat and seems to be okay with other low-energy cats in our cattery. If you're interested in Mayra, please contact Animal Haven for more information."
13,5,Male,"Roger Sterling and Ghoulia are attached by the hip! This reserved but affectionate pair are never out of sight of one another - we could never split them apart. We're looking to adopt this bonded pair together, visit them at Animal Haven, you'll definitely fall in love!"
14,16,Male,"McMuffin is the friendliest, chattiest cat you'll ever meet! McMuffin came to us with a lot going on, but after getting some extra TLC in a long-term foster home, he has recovered extremely well and has been doing great! As a senior, he's on some medication and a special diet, but he is overall an extremely easy-going guy who spends most of his day sleeping! McMuffin's day is not complete until he's held in your arms and snuggled - he's a big boy so there's a lot to hold on to! McMuffin is declawed and would probably be most comfortable as the only cat - he deserves to be the center of attention for the rest of his days. Senior cats are the biggest love bugs and still have so much love to give. If you're interested in meeting him, contact Animal Haven!"
15,3,Female,"Brooklyn was rescued with her daughter, Midwood and these two are quite attached! Brooklyn can be shy at first but has really been coming out of her shell in her foster home. Although momma likes her ""me"" time, she also loves cuddling and grooming her girl, so we would love to keep them together. If you're interested in a reserved pair of cats, please contact Animal Haven for more information."
16,2,Female,"Freesia previously resided in a local neighborhood deli, where she patrolled the shop and greeted visitors! When New York City went on ""pause"" due to COVID-19, the deli would no longer have staff there to care for her and they reached out to us for help. Animal Haven placed Freesia safely in a foster home, but with the fate of the deli unknown, she is up for adoption and looking for a new home."
17,12,Male,"Oreo arrived at Animal Haven when his owner was no longer able to care for him. Oreo is a big friendly boy that is always first to greet visitors in the room. Although he's a bit older, this guy still has plenty of pep in his step and loves leaping up to eye level to say hello! Oreo co-exists well with the cats in his room, but occasionally gets jealous if someone else is getting the attention and will push his way through to the pets! This big boy just needs a new windowsill to bask on, could it be yours? Contact Animal Haven today!"
18,2,Female,"Meet sweet Opia, our street kitty from Istanbul! She is paralyzed from the waist down and can't use her hind legs due to an accident, but that doesn't stop her from living life to the fullest! This 1-year-old domestic shorthair is friendly, curious, and would be the best lap cat. You'll never need to worry about her jumping on counters or furniture, and she would be a lovely companion for a quiet home. Her rear is sensitive, but that doesn't stop this good girl from scooting around for a chin scratch. She'll also loves laser chases! Here's a video of me in action: https://youtu.be/ks6FjPP9p78"
19,5,Female,"Say hello to Storm! This reserved lady loves to lounge and spends most of the day watching the world through the windows here at Animal Haven. Storm is shy when first meeting new people but enjoys a gentle pet around the ears and would make a fine companion for a low-traffic household. Storm is currently living in our general population rooms in our cattery and keeps to herself around the other cats. If you're interested in finding out more about Storm, please contact Animal Haven for more information!"
