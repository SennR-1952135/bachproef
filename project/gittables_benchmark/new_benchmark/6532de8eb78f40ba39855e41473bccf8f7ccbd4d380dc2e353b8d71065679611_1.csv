1,CX/1607,"Outline application for a mixed-use development, comprising: residential use (C3), employment-generating uses with employment (B1, B2, B8), local centre (A1, A2, A3, A4 and/or A5), hotel (C1) and/or care home (C2); and public open space, landscaping, highway works and associated infrastructure (17/00666/OL) was approved for the whole site in August 2018. Approval of reserved matters for 166 dwellings (17/00247/RM, Phase 1) on the west side of the site pursuant to outline planning permission 08/01085/OL. This was followed by another approval of reserved matters for 63 dwellings (19/00025/RM) which partially amended the layout approved under 17/00247/RM. This added a further 5 dwellings to the 166 houses. A Reserved Matters planning application for 97 dwellings (19/00705/RM, Phase 3) has been submitted (and approved in Nov 2019). In September 2019, two further Reserved Matters applications have been submitted; one for 156 dwellings (19/00962/RM, Phase 2) and another for 165 dwellings (19/00903/RM, Phase 4). However, Phase 2 is on Greenfield land, therefore overall housing figure on pdl reduced to 669 dwellings. 36 out of 825 dwellings have been completed in the first two years. It is expected that 30 dwellings will be completed per annum in 2019/20 and 2020/21, and 60 dwellings per annum from 2021/22 onwards, based on two housebuilders on site.|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file",local-authority-eng:NED

3,KIL/1603,Planning permission (17/00509/FL) granted for the demolition of warehousing and erection of 22 dwellings. For former outline permission (14/00380/OL) it was considered that very special circumstances do exist in the form of the benefits brought by a comprehensive redevelopment of a vacant site which would not have a significantly greater impact on the Green Belt than the existing built form. An application to discharge conditions is currently pending (19/01060/DISCON).|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file,local-authority-eng:NED

5,WW/1610 (2),"The reserved matters approval (16/00526/RM) is the first phase of re-development for 252 dwellings. This brownfield site is the central part of the larger Avenue Strategic Site which is a mixed-use redevelopment to comprise 13.4 ha of residential use providing 489 dwellings, 2.8 ha of commercial land for employment use, 1.8 ha of land for provision of a primary school, 0.4 ha of land for other community use and formal and informal play and recreation space (13/00386/OL).|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file",local-authority-eng:NED

This brownfield land represents only the north western part of the scheme in North East Derbyshire. Since planning permission was granted on site, the Government has confirmed proposals for the realignment of the proposed route for HS2, such that it runs through the eastern end of the Coalite site affecting residential development. The impact of this creates significant uncertainty for the approved scheme and the council cannot be confident that the housing development will come forward. However, in light of the proposed realignment of HS2 the developer has applied for an outline application for B1c, B2 and B8 uses (19/00925/OL) which is currently pending. The council will await the outcome of this application. If permission is granted the council would ask the developer for confirmation of their intention before withdrawing it from the register.|http://www.ne-derbyshire.gov.uk/index.php/your-council/document-library/local-plan-exam-library/03-supporting-docs-evidence-base/housing/2292-eb-hou6b-housing-sites-appendix-c/file",local-authority-eng:NED

Although the housing yield calculation of the Housing LAA would result in 3 dwellings on the site, it may be able to accommodate a higher yield of 5 dwellings. This is due to the fact that there is an existing building with two dwellings approved on site, a higher density in the surrounding area and the planning history with applications promoting 17 (16/00748/FL, withdrawn) or 20 dwellings (15/00623/FL, withdrawn) respectivley on site.",local-authority-eng:NED
