Felt pretty bad before that too, had taken a couple walking breaks because of crazy beating heart and shortness of breath. I had only had some butternut squash/chicken soup and a chocolate chip cookie, so I think that contributed. Maybe hadn't drunk enough water, though I thought I had. Temp 87.1 °F, heat index 92.8 °F or maybe 95. Hmm, that doesn't actually seem that bad. However, the new boardwalk on the river by 35 is quite nice, I can say that much."
