0,Heath Pratt,annotation,Feedback works best when the student doesn't know how they have gone.  This is a simple concept but so true and is so easily forgotten. It provides the ability for deep learning to occur as the student applies the concepts and can adapt those concepts.
1,Heath Pratt,annotation,"In contrast to feedback to the student, evaluation activities are feedback to the teachers."
2,Heath Pratt,annotation,how important is evaluating the effects of teaching!
3,Heath Pratt,annotation,"The attitude of the teacher is what makes teachers effective change mediums. It is the attitude towards their reflections and evaluation as it reflects on their teaching approach, what works and wha doesn't work that makes them more effective teachers and change managers."
4,Heath Pratt,annotation,The class student/teacher relationships about building trust. It is about establishing a rapport with the students so they can admit their knowledge shortfalls and feedback can be more effective in breaching those shortfalls.
5,Heath Pratt,annotation,"Classrooms where error is tolerated, welcomed is a classroom where learning occurs."

17,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Evidence- based teaching is gathering info on what you can do better
18,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,70% of what happens in the classroom is missed by the teacher.  Need evidence of this 70% so it can be included in the teachers' reflections
19,Fiona Nicolson,annotation,Make learning visible to the teacher
20,Fiona Nicolson,comment,Hattie emphasizes the importance of making learning visible to the teacher before the teacher reflects on the effectiveness of their teaching. He claims that the teacher's attitude and mindset as a change agent impacts more on the effectiveness of their teaching than their content knowledge or strategies. He also encourages teachers to challenge students rather than simply cover the curriculum. Hattie is very thought provoking - especially focussing on the power of the teacher in a learner centred classroom.

25,Omar Hussain,annotation,challenge students
26,Omar Hussain,annotation,important to have that ability if the teacher wants to be adaptable to what the students say. But how?
27,Omar Hussain,comment,Key points mentioned:1. Don't go over the course content. Challenge them2. Regularly evaluate your teaching.3. Build trust with students to get feedback.4. Give feedback. 5. Get an understanding or feedback of your teaching by asking.Would like to know a bit more on how to do points 1 and 2.

31,Abrar Chughtai,annotation,It is important to build trust in whole class
32,Abrar Chughtai,comment,"Prof John discussed various aspects of teaching mindset and role of teacher as leader, change agent, activator or facilitator. He mainly emphasized on getting evidence through actual feedback, not just routine data. He also discussed trust building not with the students but within whole class to prompt open discussion. Monitoring the progress of students and providing feedback is also important."

37,Sonia Graham,annotation,How do we develop ways of hearing what students are learning? I like this way of re-thinking student engagement. It resonates with some reading I was doing on peer feedback and marking yesterday.
38,Sonia Graham,annotation,Tests are about determining what you taught well to whom. Surely we should see teaching and learning as a two-way relationship. This would mean tests are about determining how well your teaching intersected with students' learning and identifying students with whom you might need to work on improving your teaching-learning relationship.
39,Sonia Graham,annotation,A world of difference between an activator and a facilitator
40,Sonia Graham,annotation,It's easy to assume students in one class are basically the same as the students in the next class and that the content only requires minor modification. A very passive approach to teaching that is unlikely to facilitate deep learning.
41,Sonia Graham,annotation,Need to develop interpersonal trust between students and between the students and the teach. This requires development of a culture of trust. If students can say they don't know this is the ultimate test of trust.
42,Sonia Graham,annotation,"The only way teaching works is if you can reflect on what happens in the classroom, not just the 30% that you observe as a teacher."
43,Sonia Graham,annotation,What feedback did you get today?
44,Sonia Graham,comment,"This video talks about the importance of feedback for helping both teachers and students by making learning visible. Feedback works best when students don't know how they've gone. Teaching works best when it involves regular feedback. Hence, John asks his sons each day, what feedback did you get today?In order to make feedback honest and effective there needs to be a culture of trust. It also requires teachers to be active and desire to be a change agent in the classroom."
45,Mariam Farida,annotation,"I found John Hattie's video very honest and straight to the point. it is hard to be a teacher and takes a lot of energy and dedication. the few points that I can take from his talk which I think are essential for teaching, and are what I try to keep note of are:1-the role of teachers as evaluators, that is teachers must know who the exams or activities they are giving are for, to know how to manage to give the students the assessments that reflect their knowledge2-for teachers to have a mindset to be realistic, and to propose challenging tasks so that students can be encouraged and supported. I try to reflect this in my classes, in which I always try to encourage students to think out of the box and maybe propose  research goals that gets them to ask big questions3- feedback is powerful, I agree with John, because teachers tend to go on with their routine without actually stopping and asking, am I doing the right thing? are students learning? but then feedback comes to answer that, peer evaluation or students' evaluation, or even informal students in class evaluation always helps, where you just have a chat with students ask them how they are going about with their studying. this can help a lot.4- another final point, is building the trust with the students, I remember I had a student last year where she wouldn't participate much but I can notice that she is interacting with the subject, so I approached her and asked her and then she had told me that she felt shy because she didn't want to look like a fool in class. I thanked her for sharing this and encouraged her to participate and that in this classroom all opinions are welcome and all errors are ok. we are here to learn. I was happy after that because she did participate and ended up with a distinction. so I think it is important to build the trust so that students will feel the good environment to share and learn!"
46,Mariam Farida,comment,"I think what John said was very honest and I agree with him on the following points:1-teachers must build trust with students so that a student can feel that they can make an error and that its ok because they are here to learn and they are not expected to know about everything2-teachers must not take evaluation for granted, it is always healthy to pause and ask/reflect if they teacher is doing everything right or if students are struggling with something3- teachers need to evaluate their own structures, exams, content..etc.. the course outcome must meet the student's abilities 4- teachers need to have a mindset to challenge students and encourage them to be active learners and to engage."
47,Anna Yeung,annotation,Being an active listener would be a handy skill in teaching.
48,Anna Yeung,annotation,"Getting away from the ""tests are for kids"" mindset - it is also a marker of how well the teacher has taught the content."
49,Anna Yeung,annotation,Love this point here - that you learn when you are challenged.
50,Anna Yeung,annotation,"Students should have the freedom to make mistakes, I think many of them are too afraid to speak."
51,Anna Yeung,comment,Challenging students encourages them to learn. Reflective teaching encourages the teachers to seek feedback and learn from those experiences.

56,Wen Hu,annotation,Evidence is more important than data
57,Takuya Kojima,annotation,It is indeed difficult to listen to how students perceive the class. They do not really express their real feelings.
58,Takuya Kojima,annotation,teachers see themselves as evaluators.
59,Takuya Kojima,annotation,evaluation is not about kid's learning but about yourself
60,Takuya Kojima,annotation,teacher's job is to seek what is appropriately challenging for students
61,Colin Clark,annotation,Students taking responsibility for their own learning seems a key point - perhaps tutors should reflect on how to engender self-efficacy.
62,Colin Clark,annotation,Interesting point - your fundamental job is to evaluate your instruction and your effects.
63,Colin Clark,annotation,"I wonder if this is not just a question of preferred jargon? Maybe he means ""developing"" and ""emerging"" involves a passive process of waiting for students to change themselves."
64,Colin Clark,annotation,He seems to see feedback as a task-focused activity - could it not also be affective/encouragement? Especially for the school children he seems to be talking about.
65,Colin Clark,annotation,Build trust before kids admit they don't know.
66,Colin Clark,annotation,70% of what happens n classroom the teacher does not see
67,Colin Clark,annotation,It would be useful if he would provide a couple of more specific examples of what he means.
68,Colin Clark,comment,"Certainly the use of evidence-based methods is important, and it applies at the individual level as well as the institutional one. However, formative evaluation should not be mixed with performance appraisals. That gives an incentive to avoid difficult questions."
69,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"""Feedback is powerful when you do not know"". I like this concept which I interpret as students feedback is very important and as important is to know how to identify situations in which feedback is more meaningful."
70,Claudio Cazorla Silva,annotation,"To create a relation with the students and also that the students create relationships between them in order to allow anyone to express freely, is a nice concept that may be useful in the primary stages of education. I find this, however, not to be necessary at other more advanced stages like, for instance, university level."
71,Claudio Cazorla Silva,comment,"""Feedback is powerful when you do not know"". I like this concept. I interpret it as that students feedback is very important but also is very important is to learn to identify the situations in which feedback can be more meaningful.To create a relation with the students and also that the students create relationships between them in order to allow anyone to express freely, is a nice concept that may be useful in the primary stages of education. I find this, however, not to be necessary at other more advanced stages like, for instance, university level.In my opinion, there is clearly a need for differentiating between teacher's attitudes and strategies depending on the context in which the learning activity takes place. At the university level, at which I work, I think other aspects like for instance being proficient on the topics that you explain, is by far more important than, for instance, creating a relationship with students. In order to define good teaching strategies or attitudes, I think that one necessarily must consider the context in which the related activities are going to take place."

73,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,Students' success depends on the teacher&rsquo;s ability to communicate new knowledge and engage students.

75,David Silvera Tawil,annotation,"A good teacher student relationship, based on trust is important"
76,David Silvera Tawil,comment,"It is important to take responsibility as a teacher. Lack of engagement and learning can be improved by taking responsibility, building trust and creating a good learning environment."
77,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This is a very empowering view of teaching. It is a lot more motivating to look at this practice as something that we can naturally shape on the basis of our awareness of a particular teaching environment, understanding of students' needs, as well as in connection to our own skills."
78,Corey Martin,annotation,What are ways that teachers and actually hear what students are learning. I.e. what is going on in their minds.
79,Corey Martin,annotation,The fundamental job of teaching is to evaluate the teachers instruction.
80,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This is an important point, which I think is also useful to re-think our CATEI survey. The adoption of a standard questionnaire to courses that are so different from one another in terms of discipline, activities, student demographic, topics discussed, etc. etc. is questionable in my view. At times, a more tailored type of feedback is need from students, so that we can better understand what we are doing and how we are doing it."
81,Corey Martin,annotation,Testing focus should be back on the teacher NOT so much on the student. i.e. how well did the teacher communicate the learning?
82,Corey Martin,annotation,Types of different approaches to teaching.
83,Valentina Bau,annotation,"This concept of trust that the speaker presents here is definitely the ideal scenario of the relationship a teacher would like to have with his/her students. I am wondering how many of us are able to get to that... I find that I am more able to build that trust, somehow, with a small number of students within a class/ i can that get some honest comments from them. They know that I value their observations and their honesty does not carry negative consequences of any kind. Perhaps this could be built with very small classes."
84,Valentina Bau,comment,"What the speaker emphasises throughout his talk is the importance of gathering that feedback, which is useful for teaching evaluation, while at the same time providing some back to students. I agree that this process is important for an effective teaching practice. The challenge is how to build that into the course, curriculum and class dynamics that often characterise each individual course."
85,Corey Martin,annotation,"Teachers who challenge students have better outcomes over those who just want to cover the curriculum and allow students to ""do their best""."
86,Corey Martin,annotation,Attitude needs more passion and time
87,Corey Martin,annotation,"Need to build trust with both individuals and between peers to create a ""safe"" environment.Ask students the question: What would happen if you don't know the answer?"
88,Corey Martin,annotation,Need to tolerate errors and welcome this to encourage the most learning.
89,Corey Martin,comment,Helpful to be direct and confront students in a way that actively seeks evidence-based feedback to improve teaching.
90,Freda Passam,comment,Prof John Hattie on this clip is an active and passionate teacher. I also agree with his points that you need time and strategy to prepare for teaching and you need to request feedback.
91,Kelly Royds,comment,What feedback did you get today? I like how Hattie looks at both teacher/learner as having similar sets of responsibilities for learning and reflection. I also agree with the idea that the trend of highlighting certain strategies and buzzwords over attitude and approach is problematic.
92,Till Boecking,annotation,Hattie proposes viewing exam outcomes as a measure of teacher success rather than student success
93,Till Boecking,annotation,Trust as a requirement for honest and meaningful feedback; feedback as a driver for teaching
94,Till Boecking,comment,"Hattie's main point is that the teacher needs to have a particular mindset or attitude towards teaching to be successful. In partiuclar, he propses that teache should constantly evaluate their student's progress and from that determine how to adjust teaching methods. This requires building trust to be able to obtain meaningful feedback."
95,Amy Teale,annotation,Importance of listening skills in a teacher
96,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Evaluate your progress as a teacher. Assessments are not just a way to allocate grades to students.
97,Jaz Lawes,comment,Mindset and attitudes are integral in successful teaching. It is important to continually measure your success as an educator. Be mindful people!
98,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Activator verses Facilitator. Activate learning to encourage independent learning by students.
99,Amy Teale,annotation,Feedback most powerful for more difficult tasks
100,Amy Teale,annotation,These are critical to getting true feedback
101,Jaz Lawes,annotation,Building trust to enable free-verbalisation between teachers and students in a group environment is key to engaging students. Students need to feel comfortable to say they do not know the answer in front of those peers.
102,Amy Teale,comment,Hattie has some interesting points about the role of teachers in gathering feedback. I agree that it is vital to build a good relationship with students to elicit genuine feedback. The focus on continually reevaluating what you as a teacher does is also important.
103,Hossein Masoumi,comment,Really interesting discussion but keen to see how in action these theories can be implemented particularly for non-social science courses.
104,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,The idea that we should move towards being about teachers and how well the information is getting across rather than students is very interesting
105,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"It was interesting what he said about jargon.  People start to focus on achieving preconceived ideas, but not really thinking about the objectives of a particular course, let alone program."
106,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,The idea of an active teacher that wants change is one that really appeals to me. It seems like placing emphasis on changing and adapting can really influence students experience. This issue I have is that I am not sure the system is designed to allow this type of teacher at university level
107,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"There seems to be a motivation for collecting evidence.  But to show whom?  Perhaps in high schools it is important, but in universities the only evidence the schools want is in the form of formal evaluations, eg. CATEI.  Or is the evidence for ourselves?"
108,Nicole Lasky,annotation,"The idea of self-regulation of young people is interesting.  I have found that if young people are treated as if they have the ability and they are respected, they seem to perform better, i.e., they are performing to expectations."
109,Nicole Lasky,comment,"I like the idea of getting back to basics of focusing on what the students need to learn, are learning, and then adapting to them to help them learn, rather than focusing on jargon."
110,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,I completely agree with the feedback point and it is one that I am very passionate in my own teaching. Feedback should be focused on constructive criticism designed to help them develop higher level skills apply knowledge. There is no point for feedback if it focuses entirely either on the easy things you have done correctly or likes and perhaps more importantly if there is no applicable structure/content to the feedback
111,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,"The concept of building trust with the entire class so that you can get honest feedback from students but also so that they allow each other to give that critical feedback is very rare but something that I have seen the benefits in my own teaching, on the occasions that it occurs"
112,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,comment,The points that most resonated with my in this clip is firstly that the feedback should be focused on actually helping the students improve. That classrooms where error is encouraged is something that I try to encourage in my classes and it has excellent consequences when I have managed to build the trust and students do feel comfortable questioning and discussing. Finally the idea of building trust so the students are comfortable with you and each other in order to allow this questioning is a very strong point
113,Heath Pratt,comment,"I took away some interesting, and to be quite honest, crucial realisations as a result of watching the video. The video highlighted important issues that I had previously suspected but until now had not had specifically addressed in this way before. The realisation that evaluation is in fact a two way street is enlightening. It is just important, if not more important for the teacher than to the student. I found the video&rsquo;s emphasis on the requirement for teachers to adopt a paradigm shift in order to see evaluation as feedback to the education deliverer and not just feedback for participating students.I also found the video refreshing as it encourages teachers to step out of their comfort zone before asking the student to step out of theirs. Hattie emphasises the fact that we learn just as much, if not more from our mistakes then from our successes. More specifically he challenges teachers to set evaluation that is challenging. He suggests that easy evaluation may undermine the learning experience for students and the development of their mental models that underpins deep learning. Both the teacher and the students should realise that effective feedback can take the form of both positive and negative reinforcement. Furthermore, the educational relationship should be one of trust upon which positive and negative reinforcement, in the form of feedback, is well received and it is then that the feedback becomes effective."
114,Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook,annotation,Absolutely love the point that classrooms which encourage error and questioning is what we should strive for. I strongly believe that questions are what drives deeper levels of learning.
115,Li Fu,annotation,Teacher as evaluation and change agent;Build trust relationship with students to collect evidence to reflect teaching.
116,Li Fu,comment,"I agree with Professor Hattie that teachers should have a mindset of teacher as evaluation and change agent.He suggests teacher should build trust relationship with student to collect evidence of students' learning, and use this to reflect teaching method and check student progress. It is helpful for me to reflect my teaching methods. But I am a little confused on what methods we can use to apply these theory to our teaching.Hope we can find further resource."
117,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,teachers are evaluators. Perhaps we should *only* be evaluators.
118,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,"Feedback works powerfully when you don't know. I like it, so I wrote it down."
119,Julia Lappin,annotation,how do we help teachers hear how their students are learning
120,Julia Lappin,annotation,if you have the mindset that when the kids take the test it helps you evaluate what you managed to teach to whom
121,Daniel Mansfield,annotation,I like the evidence based approach. Good to know if you are doing something right.
122,Julia Lappin,annotation,feedback works powerfully when you don't know
123,Julia Lappin,annotation,classrooms where error occurs are classrooms where learning is happening
124,Julia Lappin,annotation,teachers asking and collecting evidence for themselves
125,Sanja Lujic,annotation,Aspire to be an 'activator' of knowledge not merely a messenger or 'facilitator'
126,Sanja Lujic,annotation,When should feedback be sought? Not during easy exercises or clear/simple concepts. Rather gather feedback when students are in doubt/don't know
127,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Effective feedback requires trust between students and lecturers, as well as the whole class. Only when the students feel they have a safe environment will they feel comfortable providing feedback."
128,Sanja Lujic,annotation,"Teachers should be evaluators - collecting evidence of what's good/bad, what things to do differently"
129,Julie Thoms,annotation,How do we help teachers hear how students are learning?
130,Sanja Lujic,comment,"John Hattie's key points around making learning visible to teachers, collecting evidence on what happens in the classroom, determining how these impact on the effects (or effectiveness of teaching) resonate will within tertiary institutions as well. Feedback is an important driver of improving teaching , improving effectiveness, and making student experience a memorable one."
