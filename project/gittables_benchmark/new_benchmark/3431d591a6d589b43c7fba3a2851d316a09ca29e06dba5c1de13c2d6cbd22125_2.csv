Addtionally, ERE/0213/0001 outline planning permission was sought for 1950 homes and other development uses. This was withdrawn in July 2015. The Borough Council have now adopted a site based Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) setting out a Masterplan for the site's redevelopment. The SPD states that an area of 60 hectares is indicated for housing development towards the centre and south-west of the site. Provision for a primary school, sustainable drainage, open space and an internal road system will also have to be provided in this area, all of which will need to take account of the need to restore the landscape character of the dale. Design considerations will also have to take into account noise from surrounding roads and industrial uses. The site is a former iron and steel works, which is still operational in part. In relation to contaminated land, several phases of intrusive work have been undertaken historically which confirmed that ground contamination is present in soil and ground water. Confirmed contaminants on the site include heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, PAHs, sulphate, arsenic, cyanide and phenols. The range of chemicals used at the site throughout its extensive history is not fully known. Chemicals record as being stored and used at the site include (but are not limited to): methylene chloride, dichloromethane, caustic soda / sodium hydroxide, sulphuric acid, diesel, oil, dimethyl ethanolamine (DMEA) and petroleum spirits.

2,BLR3,"The site can support 25 dwellings. Industry is located in close proximity to the site. A buffer zone is required to have an acceptable area between industry and residential housing. Furthermore, the thin shape of the site reduces the ability to have houses on both sides of a proposed access road.

The site was also once home to a landfill site which was operated by Derbyshire County between 1978 and 1981. The waste deposited at this site is described as 'inert waster' but the source of the waste is unknown and it could contain industrial waste. Ground contamination is considered to be likely due to the unknown origin of waste being present. Likely contaminants are those outlined in the 'Railway Land' Department of Environment Industry Profile, produced by CL:AIRE. There is also potential for a wide range of contaminants including petroleum, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, asbestos, VOCs, SVOCs depending on the source of waste / infill.
