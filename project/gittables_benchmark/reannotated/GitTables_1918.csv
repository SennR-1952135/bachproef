0,The Aligned_Values class describes the values which align element-by-element with the elements of a observation data array. The aligned values array must have the same dimensions as the observation array.,Aligned_Values,Class
1,The Axis_Values class describes the values which are associated with the elements along an axis of a observation data array.,Axis_Values,Class
2,The index of the axis. The first axis is numbered as 1.,axis_number,Attribute
3,The Face_Values class describes the values which are associated with the elements on the face of a observation data array.,Face_Values,Class
4,The Face_Plane class describes a plane which is defined by two axes.,Face_Plane,Class
5,The axis number that defines one axis of a face plane.,face_axis,Attribute
6,The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to cross-reference other classes or objects within the product.,Local_Internal_Reference,Class
7,"The local_identifier_reference attribute provides the value of the local_identifier of the entity described by the referencing class. Note that a local_identifier attribute, with the same value as this local_identifier_reference, must be present within the label.",local_identifier_reference,Attribute
8,The local_reference_type attribute provides the name of an association between an entity identified by a local_identifier_reference and another corresponding entity identified by a local_identifier,local_reference_type,Attribute
9,A reference to the array containing the primary observation data.,particle_observation_to_observation_values,Value
10,A reference to the array containing the data values for an axis of primary observation data.,particle_observation_to_axis_values,Value
11,A reference to the array containing the data values for a face of primary observation data.,particle_observation_to_face_values,Value
12,"A reference to an array that has an identical array structure (in both axis definitions, and number of elements) as the primary observation data array.",particle_observation_to_aligned_values,Value
13,The comment attribute is a character string expressing one or more remarks or thoughts relevant to the object.,comment,Attribute
14,The Particle_Observation describes the data of a observation and the values which are associated with the elements along an axis or on the face of a observation data array.,Particle_Observation,Class
15,The name attribute provides a word or combination of words by which the object is known.,name,Attribute
16,The local_identifier attribute provides a character string which uniquely identifies the containing object within the label.,local_identifier,Attribute
17,"The description attribute provides a statement, picture in words, or account that describes or is otherwise relevant to the object.",description,Attribute
18,The Primary_Values class describes the values which are the primary observation data array.,Primary_Values,Class
